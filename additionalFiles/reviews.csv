The Shawshank Redemption,Malcolm Johnson,Hartford Courant,8.75,2024-3-4,"Next to Stand By Me, The Shawshank Redemption ranks as the strongest, purest film ever made from a novel or novella by Stephen King, a monster film where the horrors are frighteningly human."
The Shawshank Redemption,William Arnold,Seattle Post-Intelligencer,6.25,2024-3-4,"The acting is so strong, so seductive in The Shawshank Redemption that you almost don't notice this epic prison drama isn't all that good."
The Shawshank Redemption,Michael Wilmington,Chicago Tribune,8.75,2024-3-4,"The Shawshank Redemption may be working with stuff we've seen before, but it's surprisingly strong and engrossing. Even elitists in the audience who dismiss King as a shock schlockmeister may be amazed at this picture's narrative grip."
The Shawshank Redemption,Jeff Simon,Buffalo News,8.0,2024-3-4,"It's a movie with dignity and surprises and before it has finished, it has acquired a good deal of power."
The Shawshank Redemption,Jack Mathews,Newsday,7.5,2024-3-4,"You've never seen a prison movie quite like it, and I found its eccentric rhythms and the performances of co-stars Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman nearly irresistible."
The Shawshank Redemption,Gary Thompson,Philadelphia Daily News,7.5,2024-3-4,Even the most prosecutorial viewer will concede that Robbins and Freeman give The Shawshank Redemption a persuasive validity. They hold The Shawshank Redemption together as it gives way to story-driven melodrama.
The Shawshank Redemption,Desmond Ryan,Philadelphia Inquirer,6.25,2024-3-4,"A work of sincerity and honorable purpose, with a first-class cast... [But] Darabont has not found a way to resolve the problems and improbabilities that tower higher than the walls of the maximum security prison."
The Shawshank Redemption,Frank Bruni,Detroit Free Press,7.5,2024-3-4,"It's a blissfully old-fashioned melodrama spanning three decades, a classic tall tale that experiences some particularly incredible growth spurts toward the end but manages to endure them without alienating the viewer."
The Shawshank Redemption,Rene Rodriguez,Miami Herald,6.25,2024-3-4,"It's way too long, blatantly manipulative, and sentimental to a fault. Still, the lead performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are heartfelt, impressively shaded pieces of work (Freeman in particular is a marvel)."

The Godfather,Brian Viner,Daily Mail (UK),10.0,2022-2-25,The Godfather justifies every minute of its extravagant running time.
The Godfather,Danny Leigh,Financial Times,10.0,2022-2-24,"As the doomy burnish of Gordon Willis’s photography captures the darkened souls of the Corleones, the effect is flat-out mesmeric."
The Godfather,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-2-20,"Five decades later, The Godfather still resonates with the paradigm shifts from one generation to the next, still influences one filmmaker after another, and continues to be the foundation of a lasting mythology."
The Godfather,David Gonzalez,The Cinematic Reel,10.0,2022-2-18,The Godfather is a rarity in film as every element off and on screen work here.
The Godfather,Adam Kempenaar,Filmspotting,10.0,2022-2-10,There is simply not a character introduced or exchange of words or looks that doesn't inform or add.

The Dark Knight,Paul McGuire Grimes,"KSTP-TV (St. Paul, MN)",10.0,2019-11-21,"Heath Ledger gives one of the best performances of the last twenty years. When you watch his take on the Joker, it's one of complete surprise and mystery. It's frightening with how chaotic and mischievous he makes him."

Pulp Fiction,Roger Ebert,Chicago Sun-Times,10.0,2024-3-1,"Quentin Tarantino is the Jerry Lee Lewis of cinema, a pounding performer who doesn't care if he tears up the piano, as long as everybody is rocking."
Pulp Fiction,Marjorie Baumgarten,Austin Chronicle,9.0,2024-3-1,Rarely have I left a movie theatre more thrilled or invigorated as I did after leaving Pulp Fiction.
Pulp Fiction,Marylynn Uricchio,Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,10.0,2024-3-1,"A truly great soundtrack keeps the tone hip and even steals a scene or two. Not that Tarantino doesn't have plenty to spare. Pulp Fiction is riveting filmmaking funny, visceral, stylish and so unabashedly original that you never want it to end."
Pulp Fiction,Gene Siskel,Chicago Tribune,10.0,2024-3-1,"In between the violence, which does get hard R-rated extreme, the real pleasure of Pulp Fiction is listening to these folks talk. If you smile at David Mamet's dialogue, you'll laugh out loud at the words of Quentin Tarantino."
Pulp Fiction,Rene Rodriguez,Miami Herald,8.75,2024-3-1,"[Pulp Fiction] is a dazzling feat of writing. Lurid and unexpectedly hilarious, it's a deceptive piece of work that appears slight and simple on the surface but grows richer and more complex with hindsight."
Pulp Fiction,Robbie Roberts,"News & Observer (Raleigh, NC)",10.0,2024-3-1,"Quentin Tarantino, two movies into his directing career, brings to mind the early years of Godard and Truffaut, Coppola when he arrived with the Godfathers and Scorcese when he took to the streets of New York."
Pulp Fiction,Dennis King,Tulsa World,10.0,2024-3-1,Possessed of the literary grit and low-life existentialism that its title suggests Pulp Fiction is a hard-boiled work of virtuoso moviemaking by writer-director Quentin Tarantino.
Pulp Fiction,Sean P. Means,Salt Lake Tribune,10.0,2024-2-29,"What writer-director Quentin Tarantino serves up in Pulp Fiction is an all-out thrill ride -- like careening through a Raymond Chandler anthology, with Robert Altman and Dennis Miller in the back seat in a '64 Mustang doing Warp 9."
Pulp Fiction,Nanciann Cherry,Toledo Blade,10.0,2024-2-29,"Pulp Fiction runs more that 2 1/2 hours, but it's still lean and mean. Every element of the bizarre, dizzying journey is carefully conceived and executed to take its viewers into the darkest recesses of life, then, with a wink and a laugh, set them free."
Inception,Danilo Castro,Next Best Picture,9.0,2024-4-11,"Overall, “Inception” is a triumph, a perfectly oiled dream machine that can blow minds on first viewing and satisfy cinephiles on repeat viewings."

Fight Club,Kevin Maher,Times (UK),10.0,2024-3-15,From the guitar roar on the Dust Brothers' opening title track through to the thundering drums of Pixies' Where Is My Mind? it is pure synapse-splitting sensory overload and the road that commercial cinema refused to take.
Fight Club,Chuck Klosterman,Akron Beacon Journal,8.75,2023-10-26,"Fight Club is very, very, very good."
Fight Club,David Reddish,Queerty,8.75,2022-3-20,It seems like the male characters in Fight Club would be a whole lot happiernot to mention healthierif they could express respect and affection through the magic of gay sex.
Fight Club,James Croot,Stuff.co.nz,9.0,2021-10-4,"The first rule of Fight Club, as we're constantly reminded, might not be to talk about it, but once seen, it is most certainly not forgotten, even 22 years on."
Fight Club,Sean Collier,Box Office Prophets,10.0,2021-6-26,Let's not get away from the fact that Fight Club is awesome.
Fight Club,Roger Moore,Movie Nation,5.0,2021-1-31,"Cult films are seldom great films, they just connect with a corner of the audience more intensely than was intended, elevating their status. That's ""Fight Club."" And appealing to the wrong sort of cult just makes that clearer."
Fight Club,Marianna Neal,Impression Blend,10.0,2020-12-17,"It's bold, it's gritty, it's rebellious, it's unapologetic, it takes risks, and it's narrator reflects the frustrations of many people."
Fight Club,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,8.0,2020-9-11,Unsubtle subliminal messages pair with skewed perceptions to demonstrate overstressed stylization and a hopelessly circuitous plot.

Fight Club,PJ Nabarro,Patrick Nabarro,8.0,2019-10-31,The film's tongue is far too firmly in its cheek at all points of its discourse to ever take its characters' actions too much at face value.
Fight Club,Alan French,Sunshine State Cineplex,10.0,2019-8-11,"Pitt dominates the screen every second he's on it, and it simultaneously represents his weirdest, funniest and most charismatic role of his career."

Forrest Gump,Cameron Meier,MeierMovies.com,10.0,2024-3-3,Forrest was an ordinary man in extraordinary circumstances.
Forrest Gump,Michael MacCambridge,Austin American-Statesman,10.0,2024-3-1,"What makes Forrest Gump a stunning triumph, a departure from the mediocre norm? A big reason is the way the film provides a fresh perspective on the familiar experience, through the eyes of its unforgettable protagonist."
Forrest Gump,Eleanor O'Sullivan,Asbury Park Press (NJ),10.0,2024-3-1,Forrest Gump is a very fine hour for everybody involved. And it's concrete evidence that Tom Hanks is the best actor working in American film today.
Forrest Gump,Robert W. Butler,Kansas City Star,8.75,2024-3-1,Forrest Gump is about as good as Hollywood movies get.
Forrest Gump,Michael H. Price,Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com,6.0,2024-3-1,Hanks' immersion in character and his convincing interaction with fellow players make Forrest Gump -- gimmicks and all -- a pleasure.
Forrest Gump,Bob Fenster,Arizona Republic,10.0,2024-3-1,"The best art takes the biggest chances, thereby losing people who can't stretch with it. Forrest Gump is worth the effort."
Forrest Gump,Marylynn Uricchio,Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,10.0,2024-3-1,Forrest Gump is going to touch a lot of people's lives. It also has a good shot at bringing Tom Hanks a second Oscar for best actor.
Forrest Gump,Jackie Potts,Miami Herald,8.75,2024-3-1,"Loosely adapted from Winston Groom's satirical novel, Forrest Gump provides an incredibly rich and daffy historical pastiche."
Forrest Gump,Bill DuPre,"News & Observer (Raleigh, NC)",10.0,2024-3-1,Forrest Gump is a rare treat: a movie that delivers a message of hope and faith without delving into preachiness. Much of that success is due to Hanks' majestically deadpan performance.
Forrest Gump,Frank Bruni,Detroit Free Press,7.5,2024-3-1,"It turns tedious toward the end... But when it's good, it's very good, and the way it blends star Tom Hanks, who plays the title character, into actual historical film footage will tickle you to no end."
Forrest Gump,Jack Mathews,Newsday,10.0,2024-3-1,Forrest Gump manages to examine some of the basic questions of human life and to add perspective to the two most disruptive decades in modern history.
Forrest Gump,Bob Ross,Tampa Tribune,8.75,2024-3-1,"Director Robert Zemeckis is no stranger to spectacular effects. But seldom do knockout technology, superb acting and witty writing meld so satisfactorily."
Forrest Gump,David Armstrong,San Francisco Examiner,8.75,2024-3-1,It requires a delicate touch to keep from becoming precious. Director Robert Zemeckis is up to the task.
The Matrix,Mike Clark,USA Today,6.25,2023-7-13,"Though The Matrix ultimately overdoses on gloom-and-doom grunge, over-elaborate cool and especially running time, it's just clever enough to enable [the Wachowskis] to nix the sophomore jinx following 1996's Bound."
The Matrix,Katherine Monk,Vancouver Sun,6.0,2023-7-13,"If you're looking for a good spring fix of existentialist sci-fi, look no further than The Matrix -- then do everything you can to look deeper than the skin-tight surface."
The Matrix,Michael D. Reid,"Victoria Times Colonist (B.C., Canada)",8.0,2023-7-13,"Although it's sometimes too confounding for its own good and a little heavy on the Zen-inspired techno-babble, The Matrix is a consistently absorbing assault on the senses."
The Matrix,Jack Mathews,New York Daily News,7.5,2023-7-13,Give [the Wachowskis] an A for effort and three A's for those effects. The Matrix is a dazzlingly original visual adventure.
The Matrix,Terry Lawson,Detroit Free Press,2.5,2023-7-13,"Casting the robotic Reeves as the hope of humanity may be this oppressively long, self-satisfied movie's funniest gag, but it doesn't really make the game any fun. It means we get stuck with the least interesting player."
The Matrix,Rene Rodriguez,Miami Herald,6.25,2023-7-13,"The Matrix's pleasures are considerable, but they're all purely visceral, too, lacking the mythology that would have elevated the movie. The movie is best taken as the first entry in a brand-new genre: post-modern sci-fi pulp."
The Matrix,Jay Boyar,Orlando Sentinel,4.0,2023-7-13,"A futuristic paranoia extravaganza, it would seem to have far more appeal to an artificial intelligence than it would to human beings and other carbon-based life forms."
The Matrix,Rene Jordan,El Nuevo Herald (Miami),5.0,2023-7-13,"An interminable, sterile, exercise in cinematographic onanism.  [Full review in Spanish]"
The Matrix,Ron Weiskind,Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,6.25,2023-7-13,"Visually, at least, The Matrix more than lives up to its billing. Writer-directors [the Wachowskis] seem to literally bring the screen to life with action scenes that define the word kinetic."
The Matrix,Jay Stone,Ottawa Citizen,7.0,2023-7-13,"The Matrix isn't a film that is acted, exactly, but Reeves and Fishburne are both just swell and Weaving is a lot of fun as bad Agent Smith. And some of the small ideas are intriguing ones. They're the stuff of which sci-fi classics are made."
The Matrix,Elvis Mitchell,Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com,8.0,2023-7-13,"It's rare, and kind of touching, really, to see a lushly financed studio spectacular work so hard to keep everyone's attention. And with enough symbolism to keep online chat rooms busier than the day Babylon 5 was cancelled."
The Matrix,Dennis King,Tulsa World,6.25,2023-7-13,"With pounding assurance, The Matrix scores as a real triumph of technical special-effects-driven filmmaking. Sad, though, that the Wachowskis end up letting the machines run away with the show."
Goodfellas,KT Mahe,For Your Reference Podcast,9.0,2024-2-14,"Succinct filmmaking, satisfying performances and memorable dialogue assures Goodfellas position as a classic in the genre and Hollywood."
Goodfellas,Oti,For Your Reference Podcast,8.0,2024-2-14,"Goodfellas excels in detailing the protagonist's journey within the mob, with narration that enriches rather than detracts. Despite a slower final act, it remains gripping."
Goodfellas,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2024-1-26,"Goodfellas captures the pulse of gangster life, not just to understand what motivates these people and how they compartmentalize their choices, but to supply the audience with a shock treatment of aversion."
Goodfellas,Sebastian Zavala Kahn,Cinencuentro,10.0,2023-11-12,"It aged perfectly, even though many imitations have emerged in the last 33 years. In dealing with shades of grey, detestable but relatable characters, brutal violence and themes of family, friendship and crime, it feels timeless. Full review in Spanish."
Goodfellas,Terry Lawson,Dayton Daily News,10.0,2023-10-18,"It is intimately personal, yet so removed as to remain nonjudgmental, and therefore totally trustworthy. We give into it without reservation, because its maker assures us with every shot, every move that he knows exactly what he’s doing."
Goodfellas,Michael Sragow,San Francisco Examiner,7.5,2023-10-18,"This working stiff's version of The Godfather is disappointing: It lacks depth and point of view, and a rich, sustained tone. The skin-deep style is voluptuous... But all that holds the story together is the parade of investigative revelations."
Goodfellas,Bill Cosford,Miami Herald,8.75,2023-10-18,"The simple fact, as exhilarating as it is dreadful, is that after a life of crime, Hill had but one regret -- that he had to stop. This is the engine of GoodFellas, an idea as elemental as it is radical."
Goodfellas,Hal Lipper,Tampa Bay Times,10.0,2023-10-18,"Scorsese's GoodFellas is an unparalleled achievement, the most chilling and savagely droll account of mob life ever recorded on film."
Goodfellas,Jeff Simon,Buffalo News,10.0,2023-10-18,"The audience at GoodFellas spends a good deal of the movie exhilarated and laughing. It's a very funny movie, but most of the laughs are turned back on the audience. You don't get away with it."
Goodfellas,Mike McGrady,Newsday,10.0,2023-10-18,"With all the talent in this movie, singling out a specific performer seems capricious, but let me take a stab at it. I will grant you that De Niro is perfection... But let me reserve my loudest applause for Pesci."
Soorarai Pottru,Shubhra Gupta,The Indian Express,4.0,2021-2-23,"The film is marred, however, by the high-pitched melodrama whistled up every time the script needs to create fan-pleasing moments..."
Interstellar,Don Shanahan,Every Movie Has a Lesson,8.0,2023-9-4,"""Interstellar"" pushes the limits for personal interpretation of both science and fiction.

Interstellar,Danielle Solzman,Solzy at the Movies,9.0,2023-7-18,Interstellar utilizes science in a way that strives for authenticity in a science-fiction thriller and it's why we're still discussing the Christopher Nolan film today.
Interstellar,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,10.0,2022-8-22,It’s a contemplative adventure and an emotional exploration that captivated me from its opening moments.
Interstellar,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-6-30,Rarely do epics of this scope and intelligence reach theaters anymore; such serious commercial filmmaking seems like a market almost exclusively maintained by Christopher Nolan.
Interstellar,Josh Parham,Next Best Picture,9.0,2022-5-27,"While not all-together perfect, the film represents a monumental cinematic achievement that deserves to be placed high within the caliber of Nolan’s filmography."
Interstellar,Therese Lacson,Nerdophiles,6.0,2021-10-9,"The inherent message of the film brings hope, but it can definitely get waterlogged by intellectual speak and long-winded scenes."

Interstellar,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,10.0,2020-9-20,...an often insanely ambitious science fiction epic that that remains mesmerizing for most of its (admittedly overlong) running time...
Interstellar,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,8.75,2020-9-12,"Scientists will debate, theologians will contemplate, philosophers will wonder, and cinema lovers will bask in the glory of another remarkable Christopher Nolan achievement."

Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2023-7-31,"As with every Miyazaki picture, Spirited Away wants to at once amaze and familiarize you with an impossible dream, but it remains unique within his oeuvre for cementing that narrative desire into the essential groundwork of the story."
Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi,Kathryn Greenaway,Montreal Gazette,10.0,2023-7-17,Listen to Miyazaki's message. Be good. Be strong. Then sit back and bask in his brilliance.
Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi,Malcolm Johnson,Hartford Courant,8.75,2023-7-17,"This is an animated film of graphic splendor, with its realistic, often painterly backgrounds and characters who are as fanciful as the Wild Things of Maurice Sendak."
Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi,Leigh-Ann Jackson,Austin American-Statesman,10.0,2023-7-17,"In Miyazaki's hands, mundane actions like pulling a lever or pouring a cup of tea become beautiful endeavors."
Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi,Eleanor O'Sullivan,Asbury Park Press (NJ),7.5,2023-7-17,"Spirited Away has all the hallmarks of great Japanese design and there are many, many moments of wit and breathtaking beauty."
Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi,Jeet Heer,National Post,8.75,2023-7-17,"All in all, Spirited Away is a better animated feature film than anything to come out of Disney in the last 50 years."
Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi,Scott Von Doviak,Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com,7.0,2023-7-17,"Spirited Away is no secondhand fairytale retread; it's a fully imagined universe, populated by wondrous beings and haunting landscapes."
Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi,Jeff Strickler,Minneapolis Star Tribune,6.25,2023-7-17,"The plot starts suffering from dèjá vu before it's even half over. There are only so many octopus men, stink spirits and pig people you can take before they all start to blend together."
Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi,Robert W. Butler,Kansas City Star,6.25,2023-7-17,"Backgrounds have been fashioned with the delicacy of fine water colors. But for all that, Spirited Away left me pretty cold. Emotionally it's remote; narratively it seems to always be circling and never landing."
Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi,George M. Thomas,Akron Beacon Journal,6.25,2023-7-17,"Although you must admire Miyazaki's imagination, you crave cohesion in his storytelling... Spirited Away was a smash in Japan, but something gets lost in the translation here."
Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi,Christian C. Rix,St. Louis Post-Dispatch,7.0,2023-7-17,The fairy tale adventure is a wonderful exercise in storytelling imagination.

Saving Private Ryan,Wesley Lovell,Cinema Sight,8.75,2023-10-4,"Not for the squeamish, “Saving Private Ryan” is a film that does not shy away from realistic violence and paints the most vivid portrait of war on film that I’ve seen."
Saving Private Ryan,Michael Clark,Epoch Times,10.0,2021-10-25,"Arguably Spielberg's most visceral and inspired work, Saving Private Ryan speaks to devout patriotism, sacrifice and unflappable camaraderie. Sadly, these might be ideals our currently politically-divided country might never see eye-to-eye on again."
Saving Private Ryan,Fico Cangiano,CineXpress Podcast,10.0,2021-10-3,A masterpiece across the board. Steven Spielberg's war epic revolutionized the genre and medium since its release. [Full review in Spanish]
Saving Private Ryan,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,9.0,2020-9-24,The opening moments on Omaha Beach are surely the most memorable of the entire film.
Saving Private Ryan,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,10.0,2019-6-6,"An old-fashioned war picture to rule them all - gripping, utterly uncynical, with viscerally convincing and audacious battle sequences."
Saving Private Ryan,CSM Staff,Christian Science Monitor,7.5,2019-3-21,The story raises hard moral questions relating to the relative value of human lives and the overwhelming debt that may be felt by those who benefit when others sacrifice.
Saving Private Ryan,Gene Siskel,Chicago Tribune,10.0,2015-6-8,"[Saving Private Ryan] accomplishes something I had been taught was most difficult -- making an action-filled anti-war film or, at least, one that doesn't in some way glorify or lie about combat."
Saving Private Ryan,Martin Chilton,Daily Telegraph (UK),10.0,2015-6-8,"Steven Spielberg's film is not perfect: it plays its strongest card first, the middle section is slightly uneven, and there are sallies into sentimentality. But it is a modern war classic."
The Green Mile,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,7.5,2022-2-27,There are several scenes of tremendous power. But the same problems that plagued The Shawshank Redemption are in full force here.
The Green Mile,Douglas Davidson,Elements of Madness,9.0,2022-2-24,"Now, for the first time, Darabonts The Green Mile is available on 4K UHD with high-dynamic range, rejuvenating the drama, imbuing it with the visual energy to accompany its bittersweet narrative."
The Green Mile,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,8.75,2022-2-23,"At times, you notice The Green Mile tugging your heartstrings. But aside from a moment or two over the course of three hours, the viewer gives in, entrenched in the proceedings and deeply affected by the spell of these characters."
The Green Mile,Rachel Wagner,rachelsreviews.net,3.0,2019-2-28,Unfortunately the movie can never shake the uncomfortable and trope-filled premise.
The Green Mile,Nell Minow,Common Sense Media,8.0,2010-12-28,"Thoughtful, intelligent movie for older teens."
The Green Mile,John J. Puccio,Movie Metropolis,7.0,2009-12-6,"...despite the clichs and stereotypes, the film's cast manages to lift it from the depths of the commonplace and make watching it enjoyable."
The Green Mile,Ron Wells,Film Threat,7.0,2005-12-6,One of the best prison films ever made.
The Green Mile,Judith Egerton,"Courier-Journal (Louisville, KY)",8.75,2004-6-26,"Of all the movies based on King novels, The Green Mile ranks near the top -- but below Darabont's first, The Shawshank Redemption."
The Green Mile,Rick Groen,Globe and Mail,2.5,2003-4-25,"Three long hours of wind, an exercise in titanic self-importance intent on passing off klunky rhetoric as poignant drama."
The Silence of the Lambs,Sebastian Zavala Kahn,Me gusta el cine,10.0,2022-9-1,"An exceptional thriller; a film that puts us in the shoes —and in the eyes— of its protagonist as very few other productions have managed to do, introducing us to a world of killers and cannibals and the FBI agents who chase them. Full review in Spanish."
The Silence of the Lambs,Danilo Castro,Next Best Picture,10.0,2022-5-17,"It is a freak occurrence of the right director, the right script, and the right cast making something that transcends genre and reshapes popular culture."
The Silence of the Lambs,Kathy Huffhines,Detroit Free Press,8.0,2022-3-23,"Throughout the movie, Demme gets across more terror than a dozen Friday the 13ths by showing not the horrifying thing itself but the faces of people looking at horror."
The Silence of the Lambs,Lawrence Toppman,Charlotte Observer,10.0,2022-3-23,"As played by Anthony Hopkins in the performance of his film career, the amoral psychiatrist dominates the picture -- a remarkable feat, since Jodie Foster is the top-billed star and also does a superb job."
The Silence of the Lambs,Michael MacCambridge,Austin American-Statesman,8.75,2022-3-23,"The other thing that gives Silence its special charge is Hopkins' powerfully ingratiating performance as the formidable villain. Every second he's on the screen, you can't help but feel uncomfortable."
The Silence of the Lambs,Candice Russell,South Florida Sun-Sentinel,8.75,2022-3-23,A bone-chiller of superior intensity.
The Silence of the Lambs,Michael H. Price,Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com,7.0,2022-3-23,Scott Glenn's low-key portrayal keeps things anchored in normalcy and provides a scale against which the depths of Hopkins' malice and Foster's troubled nature can be measured.
The Silence of the Lambs,Eleanor O'Sullivan,Asbury Park Press (NJ),5.0,2022-3-23,"Even accepting that the movie's cruelty will be its calling card, there's still the void created by no clear point-of-view character. It's nobody's movie in particular, the opposite of Michael Mann's... Manhunter."
Star Wars,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,10.0,2022-8-25,“Star Wars” was a rare phenomenon that blossomed into a beloved franchise whose popularity and influence can be seen across the globe regardless of age.
Star Wars,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-2-14,"Star Wars belongs on a short list of important films that have been so saturated into our minds, so ingrained and present in our everyday culture, that watching the film now is almost an empty experience."
Star Wars,Tony Black,Cultural Conversation,10.0,2021-2-16,"It's far from the greatest movie ever made, but A New Hope-and its sequels-will be remembered, discussed and loved until we're all living in a galaxy far, far away."
Star Wars,Fico Cangiano,CineXpress Podcast,9.0,2021-1-19,The film that started it all. The one that made me fall in love with movies. The one that easily had me since the opening crawl and has never let me go. [Full review in Spanish]
Star Wars,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,10.0,2020-8-31,"Few films before or after it have managed to include such a celebrated, recognizable score - thanks to the masterful compositions by John Williams."
Star Wars,Matt Neal,ABC Radio (Australia),10.0,2020-7-5,"Few films are ingrained in pop culture like Star Wars, partly because few films changed cinema like Star Wars."

The Intouchables,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,9.0,2020-12-1,"Dark tragedy is frequently overshadowed by robust emotional energy, humor, and the stirring examination of values in completely opposite worlds."
The Intouchables,Amon Warmann,CineVue,8.0,2019-2-5,"The culture clash shtick is nothing new, but seldom has it been this funny, and Philippe and Driss' opposing perspectives on music, opera and art produce many a laugh-out-loud moment."
The Intouchables,James Plath,Movie Metropolis,8.0,2013-2-28,"Without getting into spoilers, can I just say how refreshing it was to watch a film about a physically challenged person that didn't end on a total downer?"

The Intouchables,Cameron Williams,The Popcorn Junkie,10.0,2012-10-28,"In the wrong hands this film could have been a sentimental mess. Luckily it's not and instead of being a film about labels, it's about people and the healing power of camaraderie."
The Intouchables,Margaret Pomeranz,At the Movies (Australia),6.0,2012-10-25,"I think a lot of people are going to enjoy it but I think it also tries too hard to please that audience and it just shrieks, aiming at that middle bar."
The Intouchables,David Stratton,At the Movies (Australia),6.0,2012-10-25,"The problem is that if, while you're having a good time with these characters, you start to think about the wider implications of the film, you might find yourself somewhat less enthralled."
The Intouchables,Lisa Nesselson,sbs.com.au,6.0,2012-10-25,Is The Intouchables an enjoyable movie if you overlook a few potentially queasy-making scenes? Absolutely. Is it great filmmaking in the neighbourhood of art? Nope.
The Intouchables,Ed Gibbs,The Sun-Herald (Australia),9.0,2012-10-22,"Oscar-nominated, lauded at festivals overseas and now, one of the most successful French pictures of all time, The Intouchables is simply irresistible."
The Departed,Allison Rose,FlickDirect,9.0,2024-4-23,"The Departed, directed by Martin Scorsese, boasts plot twists and is an Oscar-winning highlight of his illustrious career."
The Departed,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,8.75,2023-2-14,...an overlong yet mostly engrossing thriller...

The Departed,PJ Nabarro,Patrick Nabarro,6.0,2019-1-27,"The film elapses in a strange way, with the first 60% of the film feeling like an extended introduction with lots of exposition, leaving the last 40% as its conclusion."
The Departed,Namrata Joshi,Outlook,10.0,2019-1-17,"The biggest draw, of course, are the star acts: Caprio, Damon and Mark Wahlberg in particular are electric."

Gladiator,Yasser Medina,Cinefilia,8.0,2024-4-14,"As a sword and sandal epic, it still holds the exciting pulse to this day with Russell Crowe's magnificent performance and its emotional story about the Roman gladiator who fights as a liberator against a corrupt emperor. [Full review in Spanish]"

Gladiator,Chuck Klosterman,Akron Beacon Journal,7.5,2023-10-30,"The individual performances are great and the images are stunning, and -- perhaps most important -- Gladiator offers an escapist quality that makes its derivative flaws seem minor."
Gladiator,Michael Clark,Epoch Times,10.0,2023-1-19,"When the dust finally settled, “Gladiator” pulled off a few minor miracles. It catapulted Crowe into super-stardom, removed any doubt that Scott could work within any particular genre with success, and took a dusty old genre and made it new again."
Gladiator,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,8.75,2022-11-30,"Gladiator benefits from a second half that is, given its focus on Maximus’ vengeance-fueled exploits, virtually overflowing with spellbinding interludes..."
Gladiator,Bill Muller,Arizona Republic,6.0,2022-11-2,"The new film has spectacular fight scenes in dazzling sets and a familiar story about honor and betrayal, courage and cowardice. It's the perfect vehicle for some old-fashioned sword-clanging fun."
Gladiator,Dean Lamanna,Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com,8.0,2022-11-2,"Gladiator delivers everything its title promises. The surprise is that this bold revival of the period ""sword-and-sandals"" epic does so with solid acting, sure pacing and superior style interspersed with payoff-worthy pathos."
Gladiator,Malcolm Johnson,Hartford Courant,7.5,2022-11-2,"Such magnitude demands a heroically proportioned star, and Russell Crowe is the man, muscled but mournful and quietly spiritual. All hail, Maximus."
Gladiator,Marshall Fine,"Journal News (Westchester, NY)",8.75,2022-11-1,The blend of digital imagery and contemporary showmanship combine to make you feel like a privileged ticket-holder at a compellingly ghastly program in the most famous arena on Earth.
Gladiator,Rick Kisonak,Seven Days (VT),10.0,2022-11-1,"A mountain, a fever dream, an epic poem of a motion picture. Equal parts Ben-Hur and Braveheart, it is a victory not likely to be equaled any time soon."
Gladiator,Alison Gillmor,Winnipeg Free Press,9.0,2022-11-1,"Wholly improbable and voluptuously satisfying, Gladiator and its sheer shivery pleasure in cinematic spectacle and big emotion deserve a very Roman ""thumbs up."""
American History X,Wesley Lovell,Cinema Sight,7.5,2023-10-5,"Making social statements is important, but so is quality writing. The film lacks too much in one area to be brilliant, but is successful enough in other areas that it is easily a good movie."
American History X,Joseph Robinson,Fish Jelly Films (YouTube),7.0,2023-8-19,"Equal parts disturbing and honest, American History X is a sobering look at the power of role models."
American History X,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,4.0,2020-9-9,The entire project is largely amateurish and incompetent on a technical level.
American History X,Tom Meek,Cambridge Day,7.5,2020-7-8,It's a gripping drama and a useful take on learning how to unlearn systemic beliefs.
American History X,C.H. Newell,Father Son Holy Gore,10.0,2019-5-5,"A tale of intergenerational racism and all it brings upon those who fall in line with a hideous ideology. Powerful, brutal, and takes proper aim at white supremacy."
American History X,Blake Howard,2UE That Movie Show,9.0,2012-5-16,"American History X advocates that ""those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it""? It's a powerful social document and should be part of your film watching curriculum."

The Lion King,Sean P. Means,Salt Lake Tribune,8.75,2021-12-22,Disney' newest animated feature is an explosion of color and emotion. This tale of a lion cub growing up to avenge his father's death is filled with primal themes and deep feelings.

Hotaru no haka,Adam Kempenaar,Filmspotting,10.0,2022-12-7,"It’s one thing to have a film really sadden you, but I also found it sublime in its beauty... [Setsuko and Seita's] happiness together is transcendent."
Hotaru no haka,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-21,It does more than ‘tug at your heartstrings’. It evokes deeper and more complex emotions.
Hotaru no haka,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,10.0,2020-9-9,There is no aspect of this film that doesn't work beautifully.
Hotaru no haka,Chris Cabin,Slant Magazine,8.75,2018-12-30,"Isao Takahata makes survival the thematic core of the story, but he never degrades his characters or fetishizes their suffering."
Hotaru no haka,James Berardinelli,ReelViews,10.0,2018-12-28,Some movies are such singular achievements that they deserve to be seen at least once by everyone who considers himself or herself to be a lover of film. Grave of the Fireflies falls into that exclusive category.

Back to the Future,Mark Jackson,Epoch Times,10.0,2023-10-25,"The ultimate American summer blockbuster. Incredibly clever, nostalgia-packed, and never gets old. To sum up BTTF in one line: ""Last night Darth Vadar came down from the planet Vulcan and said if I didn't ask Lorraine to the dance, he'd melt my brain!!!"""
Back to the Future,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,8.75,2023-10-14,It remains the best of the series.
Back to the Future,Susie Eisenhuth,The Sun-Herald (Australia),10.0,2023-6-27,"I know it sounds a bit on the Disneyesque side, but like the hero's Delorean, it's light years away from all that. The gags, which are plentiful, are served up with a nice wry touch, and the performances all round are as zesty as Zemeckis's own."
Back to the Future,Michael D. Reid,"Victoria Times Colonist (B.C., Canada)",10.0,2023-6-27,"Just a joyously whimsical, ingeniously devised, well-written time-travel comedy that anyone from five to 95 should find splendidly entertaining."

Once Upon a Time in the West,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-3-20,"Self-aware in every respect, from his dynamic framing to the prolonged showdowns, Leone's meticulous style may distance some viewers from making an emotional connection to his work, but striking dramatic chords is hardly his principal intention."
Once Upon a Time in the West,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,8.0,2020-8-27,"Although the cast is impressive, with a significant part for a leading lady (something absent from Leone's other ventures), it's the primary antagonist who is most amusing."
Once Upon a Time in the West,David Parkinson,Radio Times,10.0,2020-3-24,An operatic masterpiece.
Once Upon a Time in the West,Josh Larsen,LarsenOnFilm,8.75,2018-6-25,"...an exaggerated, fairy-tale variation on the Western, big bad wolf and all."

Psycho,Sebastian Zavala Kahn,Me gusta el cine,9.0,2023-4-11,"A film with a flawed ending (the psychiatrist scene will always annoy me), that can still be enjoyed to this day, thanks to its incredible handling of suspense, memorable characters, iconic scenes, and extraordinary soundtrack. Full review in Spanish."
Psycho,Adam Kempenaar,Filmspotting,10.0,2023-2-10,"Not that [Marion] or we are guilty of the horrors [Norman] is, but this is a movie fundamentally about shame, of which guilt is an inextricable component."
Psycho,Victoria Luxford,City AM,10.0,2022-5-27,"Psycho still works on the big screen. Its success lies in its ability to find horror in the mundane... the true horror of Hitchcock’s masterpiece is that (Norman Bates) could be anywhere, just waiting at that next rest stop."
Psycho,Jamie Broadnax,Black Girl Nerds,10.0,2022-4-10,"The score alone is a supporting character. It makes various appearances throughout suspenseful moments in the story  most notably the shower scene. Those high-pitched, ear-piercing violin strings will forever be associated with fear and catastrophe."
Psycho,Cameron Meier,MeierMovies.com,10.0,2021-11-28,"Psycho allowed [Hitchcock] and his audience to fulfill their desires of observing a fascinating, macabre world by becoming a fly on the wall without being swatted."

Modern Times,Kate Cameron,New York Daily News,7.5,2021-5-6,"While he has borrowed a few symbolic touches from the Russian picture makers, there is nothing of real significance in Chaplin s work except his earnest desire, and his really great ability, to entertain."
Modern Times,Picture Parade,Motion Picture Magazine,10.0,2021-5-6,"Remaining silent, Charlie is more eloquent in pantomime than many other comedians are with the added use of spoken words. Poking gentle fun at mechanized industry, Charlie is comic indeed."
City Lights,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-3-20,"City Lights may be Charles Chaplin's most personal motion picture, or perhaps the film's heightened measure of emotion just makes it feel that way."
City Lights,Dudley Early,Austin American-Statesman,10.0,2022-2-12,"[The plot] isn't much; but, when written, directed, produced and starred by Charlie Chaplin it is a masterpiece."

City Lights,Irene Thirer,New York Daily News,10.0,2016-1-29,"""City Lights"" is excruciatingly funny and terribly, terribly sad. It makes you chuckle hysterically. You have the greatest time imaginable, and yet, occasionally you find little hurty lumps in your throat."
City Lights,Dan Jardine,Cinemania,9.3,2016-1-10,"City Lights is a paean to our best impulses, a plea for humanitarianism and justice."
City Lights,Matt Brunson,Creative Loafing,10.0,2014-4-18,"No filmmaker has ever been as successful as Chaplin in tugging at our heartstrings while simultaneously leaving us helpless in laughter, and this gem finds him operating at the peak of his abilities, even throwing his usual social critique into the mix."
City Lights,Scott Tobias,The Dissolve,10.0,2013-11-19,"There's dignity and folly to The Tramp in City Lights, and everything in between."
Dangal,Barbara Shulgasser,Common Sense Media,8.0,2019-3-6,Tough father trains unwilling daughters to be champions.
Dangal,Rahul Desai,Film Companion,5.0,2019-2-5,"Maybe my biggest issue with the film is that it plays safe, in sharp contrast to its sport and gender-empowering subjects: when was the last time wrestling was considered a safe career, both literally and figuratively?"
Dangal,Meena Iyer,The Times of India,9.0,2017-12-8,"It is to the film's credit that though Geeta and Babita's wins are documented, it still manages to engage the viewer with the wrestling tournaments and bring patriotic emotions to the fore. Most importantly, Dangal scores with its first-rate performances."
Dangal,Rachit Gupta,Filmfare,10.0,2017-10-30,This film is a thundering body slam of honest emotions and sheer hard work.
Dangal,Ben Sin,South China Morning Post,8.0,2017-8-19,"This feel-good sports drama based on true stories entertains and, more importantly, could empower young women to pursue male-dominated industries."
Dangal,Anupama Chopra,Hindustan Times,8.0,2016-12-22,I walked out of this film wiping away tears and feeling invincible. I felt I could wrestle down anything that hit me. How do you put a rating on that?
Dangal,Manjusha Radhakrishnan,Gulf News (UAE),8.0,2016-12-22,Dangal is the last major film to be rolled out in 2016 and Khan has saved the best for the last for his fans.

Django Unchained,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-9-20,"Quentin Tarantino continues to play with history and cinematic tradition in Django Unchained, his self-proclaimed “Southern” whose deposits of blaxploitation and Spaghetti Western filmmaking engage a violent saga of revenge and historical atrocity."
Django Unchained,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,7.0,2022-8-20,"The good moments are really good, but each of them are bookended by one questionable narrative choice or a blast of QT style that doesn’t always help the film as a whole."
Django Unchained,Danilo Castro,Next Best Picture,7.0,2022-6-23,It's a fun but flawed film on the cusp of mastery that comes up slightly short.
Django Unchained,Tony Black,Cultural Conversation,8.0,2021-2-14,"Django is another example of Tarantino looking at cultural American history through the lens of privilege, twisting truth and fiction through a grotesque, funhouse mirror."
Django Unchained,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,7.0,2020-12-1,Christoph Waltz once again turns in a performance (largely due to the writing) that is astoundingly likeable and worthy of award consideration.

The Dark Knight Rises,Patrick Cavanaugh,The Wolfman Cometh,10.0,2023-9-24,"Capping off such a successful series is a near-impossible task, with Nolan's circumvention of expectations being wholly effective, even with its minor setbacks in narrative absurdities."

3 Idiots,Sakhi Thirani,Common Sense Media,6.0,2023-9-26,"However, where 3 Idiots fails is in its blatant obsession over seriously problematic rape jokes that continually punctuate the film."
3 Idiots,Nikhat Kazmi,The Times of India,10.0,2015-5-4,Aamir Khan is stupendous as the rule-breaker Rancho. But the rest of the cast doesn't remain in the shadows.
3 Idiots,Namrata Joshi,Outlook,7.5,2015-5-4,Raju Hirani continues with the overly moral tone that defined his previous films. But it does say something of his surefootedness and craft that you still listen to him and enjoy the many lessons he teaches you.

The Lives of Others,Victor Pineyro,Seventh Art Studio,9.0,2022-6-17,"In an on itself the film is about freedom, love, compassion, solitude, and everything that gets downtrodden in an oppression regime. An incredible paradox around obsession disguised as a film. [Full review in Spanish]"

The Lives of Others,Nick Rogers,Midwest Film Journal,10.0,2010-9-19,"Activism proves tough on people who've thrived at their political patrons' blessings, and one character cruelly chooses a path of least resistance when the chips are down.

Memento,Victoria Luxford,BBC.com,10.0,2023-8-11,"Very complex detective thriller. Guy Pearce (leads) a terrific cast alongside Carrie Anne Moss. If you want to see the beginnings of how Nolan became such a big director, this is one to watch."

Memento,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,8.75,2020-9-16,Pearce is positively astounding.
Memento,Adam Kempenaar,Filmspotting,10.0,2020-4-10,"Think of all the ways that a linear film structure stabilizes us - the cause and effect chain of events. But Memento is about a character completely destabilized, so Nolan destabilizes us accordingly in a way maybe no other movie has."

Once Upon a Time in America,Nick Rogers,Midwest Film Journal,10.0,2015-1-1,"A tale of haunting introspection, unremitting power and potent symbolism. ""America"" ruminates on the corrosive effects of greed, violence, objectification and pain, and forces us to face despicable acts of a stand-in for our nation's worst impulses."
Once Upon a Time in America,Jeff Beck,Examiner.com,7.0,2014-9-29,"While Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in America"" is not quite the masterpiece that some make it out to be due to its excess, there are still plenty of things to recommend about it."

Raiders of the Lost Ark,Matt Brunson,Creative Loafing,10.0,2023-7-7,"One of the all-time greats. Harrison Ford is perfection-plus as Indiana Jones, so iconic a character that the AFI cited him as the second greatest movie hero of all time (just under Atticus Finch and just above James Bond)."
Raiders of the Lost Ark,Roger Ebert,Chicago Sun-Times,10.0,2023-5-4,"[Raiders of the Lost Ark] grabs you in the first shot, hurtles you through a series of incredible adventures, and deposits you back in reality two hours later -- breathless, dizzy, wrung-out, and with a silly grin on your face."
Raiders of the Lost Ark,Gene Siskel,Chicago Tribune,10.0,2023-5-4,"Yes, it's as entertaining as you have heard. Maybe more so. Raiders of the Lost Ark is, in fact, about as entertaining as a commercial movie can be."
Raiders of the Lost Ark,Jack Garner,Rochester Democrat and Chronicle,10.0,2023-5-4,"Raiders is as snappy as the crack of a whip, as daring as a leap over a snake-infested ravine, as rowdy as a fistfight in a grimy bar in Nepal, and as much fun as you could ever want in a film."
Raiders of the Lost Ark,Joseph Gelmis,Newsday,10.0,2023-5-4,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is a heady mixture of high adventure, street-smart humor and hardboiled romance in the midst of nonstop lethal battles between the forces of -- yes -- good and evil."
Raiders of the Lost Ark,Sumner Rand,Orlando Sentinel,8.0,2023-5-4,"John Williams, who wrote the atmospheric musical backgrounds for Star Wars and Empire, has succeeded again for Raiders."

Apocalypse Now,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,8.75,2020-9-2,Apocalypse Now is the kind of film that makes me thank God I fell in love with cinema.
Apocalypse Now,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,10.0,2020-8-27,"Artistically, it's quite reminiscent of film noir, with an abundance of deep shadows, a desolate voiceover by Willard, and a cast of morally unstructured antiheroes."
Apocalypse Now,Tom Meek,Cambridge Day,10.0,2020-7-28,One of the great films of the (arguably) greatest decade in American cinema...
Alien,Casey Chong,Casey's Movie Mania,10.0,2024-4-26,Still a masterpiece of slow-burning dread and terror.
Alien,Roy Peter Clark,Tampa Bay Times,10.0,2023-11-16,"Ridley Scott's new film Alien, destined to become the scary smash of summer, returns us to our senses. Our bad dreams [about extraterrestrials] were right."
Alien,Walter V. Addiego,San Francisco Examiner,7.5,2023-11-16,"Scott seems ponderous about getting through simple plot mechanics... But for those who like this kind of film, he's produced something like the equivalent of every amusement park ride rolled into one."
Witness for the Prosecution,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,10.0,2024-2-10,"Along with 1945’s And Then There Were None, this is the greatest of all the Agatha Christie adaptations that have been brought to the screen."
Witness for the Prosecution,Ian Kane,Epoch Times,9.0,2023-1-17,"In the end, “Witness for the Prosecution” is a taut, fascinating character study featuring crisp acting, excellent direction, and a compelling plot with many unexpected twists that will keep you guessing..."
Witness for the Prosecution,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,8.0,2022-9-22,"Although the picture centers upon the titular, hostile witness for the prosecution and the shocks presented from that climactic testimony, it’s Laughton’s performance that remains most memorable."
Witness for the Prosecution,Tom Cassidy,Common Sense Media,10.0,2021-12-2,"Part comedy, part thrilling courtroom drama and a mystery until the very end, this is a quiet classic. Case closed."
Witness for the Prosecution,Nicholas Bell,IONCINEMA.com,7.0,2020-11-4,"Witness for the Prosecution may wrap itself up a bit smugly, even as it spins a sharp twist, but it still stands as one of the more notable courtroom dramas even as it crackles along on a sort of contrived artifice."
Witness for the Prosecution,Martyn Conterio,CineVue,8.0,2018-9-11,"Laughton knocks it out of the park as Robarts, and his scenes with real-life missus Lanchester are hysterical."
Witness for the Prosecution,Ken Hanke,"Mountain Xpress (Asheville, NC)",9.0,2014-10-17,"Every time the story strays from Sir Wilfrid, the interest level goes down a notch. Fortunately for the viewer, it doesn't get away from him very long at any point."
Witness for the Prosecution,Noel Murray,The Dissolve,9.0,2014-7-22,"Witness For The Prosecution has the pace and patience of live theater, but not the look. Wilder doesn't get overly flashy with camera moves and angles, but he does shift positioning subtly and effectively."
Witness for the Prosecution,David Parkinson,Empire Magazine,8.0,2012-2-8,Marlene Dietrich tries not to give anything away as usual while Agatha Christie's whodunit plot whirs tidily about her expressionless beauty.

Paths of Glory,Kevin Maher,Times (UK),10.0,2024-3-1,The director Stanley Kubrick and the producer-star Kirk Douglas anticipated the countercultural energy of the 1960s with this angry anti-war parable.
Paths of Glory,Roger Moore,Movie Nation,10.0,2023-6-22,"A brisk and biting World War I anti-war film, a politicized combat movie that reset the standard for trench warfare movies."
Paths of Glory,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,10.0,2022-9-25,"Arguably the greatest antiwar film ever made, Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory feels like a mule kick to the stomach no matter how many times one has seen it (in my case, too many to recall)."
Paths of Glory,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,8.0,2022-8-24,The film also excels thanks to Kubrick’s visual choices particularly his decision to shoot in black and white. It is perfect considering the harshness of the material and the morally murky waters we navigate through.
Paths of Glory,Danielle Solzman,Solzy at the Movies,8.0,2022-8-23,"Language issues notwithstanding, Stanley Kubrick certainly knows what he's doing with Paths of Glory."

Paths of Glory,Matthew Rozsa,matthewrozsa.com,10.0,2021-9-7,"For those who like to contemplate politics and philosophy through well-written narrative drama, it is a welcome distraction."
Paths of Glory,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,10.0,2020-8-23,"An eye-opening, thought-provoking, powerful war picture that isn't so much anti-war as it is anti-politics, anti-corruption, and anti-authoritarianism."
Rear Window,Sebastian Zavala Kahn,Me gusta el cine,10.0,2023-4-3,"Mixing drama, with a bit of dry comedy, and the thriller elements to which Hitchcock had accustomed us, ""Rear Window"" is one of the best films of his filmography, and an interesting metatextual commentary on voyeurism. Full review in Spanish."
Rear Window,Danielle Solzman,Solzy at the Movies,10.0,2023-3-20,The Oscar-nominated Rear Window isn't just one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films but one of the greatest thrillers ever made.

Rear Window,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,10.0,2022-8-24,It’s straightforward and mysterious at the same time and features characters that are more complex than they appear on the surface.
Rear Window,Matt Neal,Movies Ate My Life,10.0,2022-6-20,"Psycho may be more daring and thrilling (and ultimately better), and Vertigo certainly has its fans for its unique stylings and deep themes, but Rear Window is the quintessential Hitchcock film."
Rear Window,Wesley Lovell,Cinema Sight,10.0,2022-2-12,"One of the defining characteristics of Alfred Hitchcocks cinematic oeuvre is his constant need to innovate and iterate on ideas, taking audiences to new and compelling places. Rear Window is not his most ambitious gimmick, but it is his most successful."
Rear Window,Terry Hiller,Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com,10.0,2021-6-8,It's a great movie and it's a chance in a million to see a passionate Grace Kelly... She had so much class it would be easy to overlook that underlying heat which Hitchcock let play in this film.
Rear Window,John Monaghan,Detroit Free Press,10.0,2021-6-8,"Sure, Vertigo is more personal, Psycho more bizarre, North by Northwest more thrilling. But Rear Window shows the Master of Suspense at his most spare, sophisticated and sinisterly clever a movie that is essentially about watching movies."
Tumbbad,Tim Brayton,Alternate Ending,8.0,2024-4-14,The film creeps into your bones and gives you a little shiver of discomfort at how very unknowable the world is.
Tumbbad,Anna M.M. Vetticad,Firstpost,7.0,2021-1-11,... genre-defying folksy fantasy flick ...
Tumbbad,Emma Wolfe,SpookyAstronauts,5.0,2020-10-21,"An interesting movie and I do think it's worthy of your time but it's a long, long, movie about a moral that we all know we all know."

Tumbbad,Rahul Desai,Film Companion,6.0,2018-10-12,"The trick maybe is to digest Tumbbad as a dark bedtime story narrated by an orthodox Brahmin father to his kids every night. The morality and broadness of this universe is his, but the wild texture and density of details aren't."
Andhadhun,Kumar Shyam,The National (UAE),7.0,2018-10-5,"As the chain of events unfold, the wit is very nicely interspersed with hard-hitting moments of greed and deceit providing a shock-and-awe effect that leaves you wondering how vulnerable can a common man be."
Andhadhun,Manjusha Radhakrishnan,Gulf News (UAE),7.0,2018-10-5,You have to hand it to director Raghavan for not giving us perfectly sealed endings. He never wraps things up neatly and allows or expects the viewers to do the crazy math.
Andhadhun,Devesh Sharma,Filmfare,7.0,2018-10-5,Watch Andhadhun for it's zig zag storyline and spot on acting by the entire cast. It's one of those mysteries which you'll like to go back to despite knowing the ending.
Andhadhun,Anupama Chopra,Film Companion,7.0,2018-10-5,"There's murder, betrayal, sex and a mountain of lies. In short, you can't look away. But as it happens too often in Hindi cinema, the energy takes a beating post-interval."

Drishyam,Sakhi Thirani,Common Sense Media,6.0,2023-6-29,Truth is exposed as malleable and perspective remains essential in both forging and wiping out evidence. Performances by the entire cast are stellar and the plot twists are intriguing.
Drishyam,Anil Sinanan,Time Out,6.0,2017-10-21,"Admirable but frustratingly simplistic in places, this overlong drama feels a bit too heavily plotted in places. It is redeemed by the dignified performances from its seasoned cast."
Drishyam,Deepika Shetty,The Straits Times (Singapore),6.0,2016-5-25,"While director Nishikant Kamat's direction needs some help in the first half in particular, there is nothing to fault in writer Jeethu Joseph's original story, which is the stuff cult classics are made of."
Drishyam,Aswin J Kumar,The Times of India,9.0,2015-10-12,Drishyam is an elegantly crafted piece of film which Lal and Joseph can proudly hold close to their hearts.
Drishyam,Namrata Joshi,Outlook,6.25,2015-8-11,"Shriya, as his wife, looks way too young to carry off the role of the mother of a teen with conviction. Even the usually bankable Tabu, as the cop who locks horns with Vijay, seems strangely faded and dispassionate."
Drishyam,Shubhra Gupta,The Indian Express,5.0,2015-8-3,"The premise is engrossing enough, and there is enough of a pay-off when things gather steam, but the film tries our patience in the languid build-up."
Drishyam,Rohit Vats,Hindustan Times,7.0,2015-8-3,"Stunning, gripping, edge-of-the-seat, shocking, engrossing... use any of these adjectives for this Ajay Devgn version of Drishyam."

Drishyam,Mike McCahill,Guardian,6.0,2015-8-3,"Even on its third spin, this story still feels fresh, urgent and relevant to a moment when we're surrounded by screens."
Drishyam,Saibal Chatterjee,NDTV,6.0,2015-7-30,Drishyam is gripping in parts but is anything but an unblemished humdinger.
Drishyam,Meena Iyer,The Times of India,8.0,2015-7-30,"A suspense drama with a nail-biting finish, Drishyam holds the viewer by the eyeballs till its engaging climax."
Jodaeiye Nader az Simin,Angelos Koutsourakis,PopMatters,7.0,2024-2-23,"Equally important is that the film avoids oversimplistic condemnations of the Iranian regime, showing that oppression can be propagated unconsciously, even by those who are at the bottom of society."
Jodaeiye Nader az Simin,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-19,It touches on a reality of life that transcends any political or cultural barrier while also offering some thought-provoking insight into the religious laws and social structure of that part of the world.
Jodaeiye Nader az Simin,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-2-21,A Separation stimulates discussion about how the characters behave and how we feel about their choices.
Jodaeiye Nader az Simin,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,8.75,2020-9-1,"The beauty of A Separation, and what one can only hope will help sell it to American audiences, is the universality of its themes, messages and conflicts."
Jodaeiye Nader az Simin,Katie Smith-Wong,Musings of Guitargalchina,9.0,2019-12-10,"[T]he X Factor in A Separation lies with its cast, bringing the extraordinary out of the seemingly ordinary."
Jodaeiye Nader az Simin,Mattie Lucas,From the Front Row,10.0,2019-8-6,Farhadi discovers simple yet deeply human truths - that the divides that so often separate us can seem so impossibly wide are never quite as far as we imagine.
Jodaeiye Nader az Simin,PJ Nabarro,Patrick Nabarro,8.0,2019-3-15,"Cleverly, A Separation doesn't conspicuously proselytise about its socio-political import; it is largely concerned with matters of the family that to some degree are universal"
Jodaeiye Nader az Simin,Kelly Jane Torrance,Washington Examiner,8.75,2019-1-4,"Just as nuanced, but with a bigger emotional punch, is the rest of this Rashomon-like tale of right and wrong, life and death, actions and consequences, all of which reveal various particulars of life in Tehran."
Jodaeiye Nader az Simin,Joseph Walsh,CineVue,8.0,2018-8-29,The complexity of the characters is wonderful; as a viewer you in one scene enraged at their actions then following a plot twist in the next scene you are wholeheartedly sympathizing with them.
Jodaeiye Nader az Simin,Laura Hiros,Rincón de cine,10.0,2018-3-16,Simply exceptional. [Full review in Spanish]

Good Will Hunting,Wesley Lovell,Cinema Sight,8.75,2022-11-23,Good Will Hunting is a grand coup from first-time writers Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. Their exploration of the life of a Genius trying to function as a normal person is quite amiable and full of great acting.
Good Will Hunting,Mark Jackson,Epoch Times,9.0,2021-8-19,"It's writer-stars Matt Damon & Ben Affleck's childhood friendship-chemistry and the hilarious bickering between the real-life Affleck brothers that generates the magic in ""Good Will Hunting.""

Reservoir Dogs,Aaron Neuwirth,Why So Blu,9.0,2022-11-19,"An indie cult classic from the 90s, here's a film that's oozed cool all the way through thanks to the combo of a fiery set of character actors led by the intense Harvey Keitel, and its sharp ear for dialogue filled with profanity and pop culture."

Reservoir Dogs,Tom Meek,Cambridge Day,7.5,2020-4-6,"The wafer-thin plot gets stretched far with smart, nonlinear weaves and a masterful cast crowned by Michael Madsen's trigger-happy psychopath and Lawrence Tierney's amiably gruff head honcho."
Reservoir Dogs,PJ Nabarro,Patrick Nabarro,8.0,2018-11-10,Tarantino's jumbling of his chronology and the clever changes of context from the claustrophobic warehouse section to various character origin flashbacks are sly and electric
Reservoir Dogs,Kathleen Carroll,New York Daily News,6.25,2016-1-21,"The exaggerated raw violence of ""Reservoir Dogs"" leaves one feeling cheated in the end. For this movie isn't really about anything. It's just a flashy, stylistically daring exercise in cinematic mayhem."

Scarface,Tom Sabulis,Tampa Bay Times,4.0,2023-5-12,"Scarface clearly lacks the suspense, macabre style and the deranged wit of previous De Palma films such as Carrie and Dressed to Kill. It is too slow for an action movie and too bent on destruction to make it for serious moviegoers."
Scarface,Eddie Harrison,film-authority.com,10.0,2023-5-11,…packs the punch of a grenade-launcher…
Scarface,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,6.0,2020-9-7,"It will primarily be remembered as a machine-gun-soaked actioner of tough talk, cinematic betrayals and retribution, and mountains of cocaine."

Scarface,Kathleen Carroll,New York Daily News,5.0,2015-12-9,"Stone sticks all too closely to the dated plot structure of the original movie, and such melodramatic flourishes as Montana's incestuous attraction for his sister now seem completely ludicrous."
Scarface,Alan Jones,Radio Times,8.0,2014-7-30,"The sharp, if expletive-ridden, dialogue in Oliver Stone's script and the vivid cinematography of John A Alonzo help make De Palma's urban shocker a modern-day classic."
Scarface,Nick Rogers,Midwest Film Journal,8.0,2014-1-3,"One fundamentally dishonest character choice launched a billion-dollar industry. But it hardly sours a film that became a garishly ghoulish, bleakly funny and compulsively watchable template for modern-criminal deconstructions of the American Dream."
Das Boot,Judy Stone,San Francisco Examiner,7.5,2021-11-11,"Director Wolfgang Petersen has rigorously discarded war movie clichés, both American and those of the Nazi regime, to show the very human fears and real courage of Germans who battled for, and lost, supremacy of the seas."
Das Boot,Tom Cassidy,Common Sense Media,10.0,2021-6-21,"Effective as an anti-war movie and as thrilling as any disaster flick, Das Boot is a humanistic masterpiece."

Taxi Driver,Gene Siskel,Chicago Tribune,7.5,2023-10-6,"Remove the cataclysmic ending from Taxi Driver and it would be one smashingly good motion picture. As it stands, the film is beautiful to look at, exciting to listen to, but much too much to stomach."
Lawrence of Arabia,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,10.0,2023-2-15,"The second half isn’t quite as compelling as the first, but to paraphrase a comment I once read regarding another film: The first half is pure perfection, and then it devolves into one of the best movies ever made."

The Apartment,Josiah Teal,Film Threat,10.0,2022-3-24,"The picture is brimming with crisp, quick one-liners and sharp dialogue – all setting up the next moment of banter. Each conversation or character interaction is an exploration of motivation and rich emotion."
North by Northwest,Roger Moore,Movie Nation,10.0,2024-2-11,"An effortless two hours and sixteen minutes of classic set-pieces, unlikely traps and amusingly off-the-cuff escapes, all starring the handsomest tan ever to step onto a film set."
North by Northwest,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-24,"It’s lighter, flashier, and more stylish than some of Hitch’s other classics, but those are the things that make it a unique but fitting part of Hitchcock’s wonderful filmography."

Vertigo,Sebastian Zavala Kahn,Me gusta el cine,9.0,2023-4-17,"It's a product of its time (especially when it comes to the treatment of the female characters), and it's not trying to be just a thriller. Rather, it is a story about a doomed romance that turns into a dangerous obsession. Full review in Spanish."
Vertigo,Wesley Lovell,Cinema Sight,10.0,2022-11-26,Vertigo is a film with numerous layers that can be discussed in depth and at length. That’s not to say it isn’t also an enjoyable film. Hitchcock knew how to make them. That’s why his films are generally beloved by critics and audiences alike.
Vertigo,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-3-21,A motion picture of incomparable dramatic involvement and hypnotic filmmaking.
Vertigo,Kevin Carr,Fat Guys at the Movies,7.5,2021-9-10,"It's probably the most impeccably put together Hitchcock movie... but ultimately it's men trying to control women, and that doesn't ring very well right now."

Ikiru,Dorothy Masters,New York Daily News,7.5,2021-9-22,"[Kurosawa] is implemented with satirical brilliance and fine human interest... Lassitude in bureaucracy and skullduggery in politics are here to stay, he concedes, and only does the soul of man transcend his frailties."
Ikiru,James Berardinelli,ReelViews,10.0,2021-6-7,"A thoughtful, existential meditation about the meaning of life and what constitutes a life well-lived, Ikiru is almost guaranteed to prod the viewer to examine his or her own mortality and ponder how, in the end, the scales will tip."
Ikiru,Nicholas Bell,IONCINEMA.com,9.0,2020-10-20,"Moving without being sentimental, Kurosawa reaches the sort of emotional depths akin to early Frank Capra films, where cynicism was pushed aside by the integrity of the human spirit."
Ikiru,Adrian Turner,Radio Times,10.0,2020-6-12,"Such is the delicacy of Kurosawa's direction, and the discreet power of Takashi Shimura's central performance, that you will be moved to tears."
Double Indemnity,Joe Lipsett,Bloody Disgusting,10.0,2022-12-5,"It’s not just writing and direction that ultimately cement the film’s status as a classic text, though; it’s the performance by Stanwyck as the sexy, manipulative, cold-blooded femme fatale."
Double Indemnity,Wesley Lovell,Cinema Sight,6.25,2022-11-26,"“Double Indemnity” is a largely uneven film that works in the end. Anyone looking for film noir can look no further, but if you’re looking for tons of suspense, check out Wilder’s other mystery classic."
Double Indemnity,Josh Larsen,LarsenOnFilm,8.75,2022-9-8,...it’s a thrill to watch Stanwyck go to work and assert her dominance.
Double Indemnity,Jeffrey M. Anderson,Combustible Celluloid,10.0,2022-6-11,"Billy Wilder's first great movie. It's quite unlike anything else the director ever made, a hard, smooth, crime film full of cynicism and lust and constantly alive and tingling."
Double Indemnity,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-2-14,"A cynical and shrewd motion picture, full of wit and acid."
Citizen Kane,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,10.0,2022-8-19,A monumental film in cinema history.
Citizen Kane,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-2-14,"Perhaps the film's most resonant quality is that, through the film's story and production, Welles inspires the same investigative process about himself and his picture."
Citizen Kane,Michael Clark,Epoch Times,10.0,2022-1-9,"""Citizen Kane"" forever changed the way movies were made and interpreted. It's still relevant and unique 80 years after its release. Is it the greatest movie ever? Maybe, maybe not. The most influential? Without a doubt, yes."
Citizen Kane,Michael J. Casey,Boulder Weekly,10.0,2021-12-2,"I can't think of an American-made film that stands up to multiple viewings quite like 'Kane'...it never feels like Welles and company are showing off, just showing what a movie can do."
The Kid,Nell Minow,Common Sense Media,8.0,2010-12-28,Very funny and genuinely insightful family movie.
The Kid,Michael Dequina,TheMovieReport.com,5.0,2010-1-7,There's something even more hard-to-take than a cherubic tot trying his or her darndest to be adorable: it's an ugly kid acting annoying.

Chhichhore,Devesh Sharma,Filmfare,7.0,2019-9-6,"All-in-all, Chhichhore is a well-acted comedy providing plenty of laughs with its one-liners and talks about an important issue as well. What more can one ask for, really?"
Chhichhore,Sreeparna Sengupta,The Times of India,7.0,2019-9-6,It tells you that the journey is far more important than the destination and that losing is as critical a life lesson as winning. The film scores high on many accounts and is certainly worth watching.
Chhichhore,Anna M.M. Vetticad,Firstpost,3.5,2019-9-6,"There are too many draggy patches in between, the acting is inconsistent, and the somewhat superficial messaging adds nothing to the ""what matters is that you tried"" line we have heard before."
Green Book,Denise Pieniazek,Puesta en Escena (AR),8.0,2024-1-27,"Green Book tells the story of the friendship between the renowned pianist and composer Don Shirley, and his driver and bodyguard Tony “Lip” Vallelonga in the sixties. The different cultures and social classes will be the main focus of the action."
Green Book,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,7.0,2022-8-21,The biggest strength lies in the chemistry between Mortensen and Ali. Without it the entire movie would fall apart.
Green Book,M.N. Miller,Ready Steady Cut,8.0,2022-8-17,"Green Book is not for the cold-hearted cynic, but for the romantic moviegoer who wants nothing more than to see the good in people and let that feeling wash over them."
Green Book,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,7.5,2022-3-8,"Tears will be shed, laughs will be had, and crowds will love it. The viewer might not always feel good about how those reactions are achieved; despite the overwhelming feel-goodness of the experience, you can see Green Book's gears operating."
Green Book,Ben Turner,The Pink Lens,8.0,2021-9-1,"This is a deftly scripted comedy with a message. Anchored by two outstanding performances, this true story of an unlikely friendship will warm even the most jaded of hearts with its comic look on a dark chapter of American history."
Green Book,Nicolás Delgadillo,Discussing Film,5.0,2021-6-25,It's irresponsible and dismissive of the very thing it seemingly wants to talk about.
Green Book,Richard Crouse,Richard Crouse,8.0,2021-2-3,"Probably could have hit a little harder but its message of unity, of creating bridges rather than walls, is a welcome one in these politically divisive times."
Green Book,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,7.0,2020-12-6,"The two leads are quite impressive, managing to overcome the limitations of their largely stock roles."

Green Book,Jason Fraley,"WTOP (Washington, D.C.)",10.0,2020-8-29,"""Green Book"" is one of those rare crowd pleasers with the chops to go the Oscar distance. It's a film most easily described as a reverse ""Driving Miss Daisy"" (1989) when really it's so much more than that."
Green Book,Tom Beasley,Flickering Myth,6.0,2020-8-16,"For the most part it's solid, even though it's about as subtle as a piano falling down a flight of stairs."
Green Book,Matt Cipolla,Film Monthly,4.0,2020-7-25,Ali is stuck trying to breathe life into a cardboard cutout of a real person who . . . is left standing like an uncooked noodle who only curdles when the script lets him.
Talvar,Nick Evan-Cook,One Room With A View,4.0,2019-4-18,"Pleasantly enjoyable yet slightly daft for much of its runtime, Guilty is fatally damaged by its abrupt ending, which offers no form of payoff whatsoever."
Talvar,Deepika Shetty,The Straits Times (Singapore),8.0,2016-5-24,This docudrama-style thriller hits a raw nerve with a taut script by Vishal Bhardwaj that even-handedly covers the various aspects of the investigation and offers many different versions of the truth.
Talvar,Jennie Kermode,Eye for Film,8.0,2016-2-22,"One of the bleakest whodunnits to grace our screens for some time, for all its wit and intermittent playfulness, this slice of Noida noir is full of compromised characters."
Talvar,Stefan Pape,HeyUGuys,6.0,2015-10-20,"A tense, taut and thrilling piece of cinema."
Talvar,Sweta Kaushal,Hindustan Times,7.0,2015-10-19,"A tightly written narrative and mostly rational view of the investigations ensure Talvar is an edge-of-the-seat, engaging thriller that seeks to shock its audience."
Talvar,Namrata Joshi,Outlook,7.5,2015-10-19,"What also works wonderfully is the film's sense of the place. Noida -- be it the residential colony, the flat or the cop station -- feels utterly real."
Talvar,Shubhra Gupta,The Indian Express,6.0,2015-10-19,"A brave film that devastates, and despite its flaws, makes for a compelling watch."
Talvar,Srijana Mitra Das,The Times of India,9.0,2015-10-1,"Straight away, Talvar is super-sharp, a sword swipe at Bollywood's song-and-dance, mehendi-fuelled escapism."
Klaus,Nicolas Soto,But Why Tho? A Geek Community,10.0,2023-1-22,The acts of kindness that [Klaus] talks about are just as important as everything else. I’ll surely make it a tradition to watch this film on Christmas Day.

Klaus,Jared Mobarak,Jaredmobarak.com,8.0,2020-2-4,"Beyond the approachable storytelling, fun cast, and revisionist mythology, however, lies the stunning craftsmanship of the animation itself."
Drishyam,Sakhi Thirani,Common Sense Media,6.0,2023-6-29,Truth is exposed as malleable and perspective remains essential in both forging and wiping out evidence. Performances by the entire cast are stellar and the plot twists are intriguing.
Drishyam,Anil Sinanan,Time Out,6.0,2017-10-21,"Admirable but frustratingly simplistic in places, this overlong drama feels a bit too heavily plotted in places. It is redeemed by the dignified performances from its seasoned cast."
Drishyam,Deepika Shetty,The Straits Times (Singapore),6.0,2016-5-25,"While director Nishikant Kamat's direction needs some help in the first half in particular, there is nothing to fault in writer Jeethu Joseph's original story, which is the stuff cult classics are made of."
Drishyam,Aswin J Kumar,The Times of India,9.0,2015-10-12,Drishyam is an elegantly crafted piece of film which Lal and Joseph can proudly hold close to their hearts.
Drishyam,Namrata Joshi,Outlook,6.25,2015-8-11,"Shriya, as his wife, looks way too young to carry off the role of the mother of a teen with conviction. Even the usually bankable Tabu, as the cop who locks horns with Vijay, seems strangely faded and dispassionate."
Drishyam,Shubhra Gupta,The Indian Express,5.0,2015-8-3,"The premise is engrossing enough, and there is enough of a pay-off when things gather steam, but the film tries our patience in the languid build-up."
Drishyam,Rohit Vats,Hindustan Times,7.0,2015-8-3,"Stunning, gripping, edge-of-the-seat, shocking, engrossing... use any of these adjectives for this Ajay Devgn version of Drishyam."
Drishyam,Abhinav Purohit,The National (UAE),6.0,2015-8-3,"The film has a gripping plot with plenty of twists, as Vijay tries to stay one step ahead of the cops."
Drishyam,Mike McCahill,Guardian,6.0,2015-8-3,"Even on its third spin, this story still feels fresh, urgent and relevant to a moment when we're surrounded by screens."
Drishyam,Saibal Chatterjee,NDTV,6.0,2015-7-30,Drishyam is gripping in parts but is anything but an unblemished humdinger.
Drishyam,Meena Iyer,The Times of India,8.0,2015-7-30,"A suspense drama with a nail-biting finish, Drishyam holds the viewer by the eyeballs till its engaging climax."

Mandariinid,Peter Calder,New Zealand Herald,7.0,2016-5-6,"Ulfsak, by all accounts Estonia's Olivier, is the pivot of the all-male cast, his mournful face bringing an intense gravitas to proceedings in an small, but engrossing and handsome film."
Mandariinid,Tara Brady,Irish Times,8.0,2016-3-2,Those faultless performances make something special of the material. Many will find it disconcerting to be reminded of the many conflicts... that blew up following the fall of the Soviet empire. Worth cherishing.
Mandariinid,Alistair Harkness,Scotsman,6.0,2015-9-20,"Tangerines explores the absurdities and complexities of the ensuing nationalistic, territorial and religious fall-out with an admirably simple set-up."

Bhaag Milkha Bhaag,Anna M.M. Vetticad,annavetticadgoes2themovies,7.0,2022-8-5,"The dominant force in Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is Farhan Akhtar. ...The star has invested every cell of his being, every bulging muscle, every pulsating vein in this one character. This is an actor living a part."
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag,Anil Sinanan,Time Out,6.0,2017-10-23,"Overlong and stuffed with too many catchy but unnecessary songs, this worthy film is nevertheless indicative of a more sensible and sensitive side of Bollywood."
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag,Madhureeta Mukherjee,The Times of India,8.0,2015-5-17,"Mehra is brilliant at his craft; he infuses realism into drama, and explores characters so deeply and sensitively through tragedy and triumph, that it sparks an emotional deluge."
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag,Saibal Chatterjee,NDTV,5.0,2015-5-17,The much anticipated Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is anything but the film that Milkha Singh deserves.
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag,Namrata Joshi,Outlook,5.0,2015-5-17,"There is a compelling biopic hidden somewhere in Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, about an athlete with a traumatic childhood facing up to and conquering the ghosts of his past. But the overwritten film meanders aimlessly."
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag,Shubhra Gupta,The Indian Express,5.0,2015-5-17,"The face of a winner, at the end of a tough race, is such a win in itself. Is there any need to underline it, just in case we miss the point, with loud background music?"
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag,Priya Joshi,Digital Spy,8.0,2015-5-17,It is a blessing that this film was made and the inspiring story of India's greatest sporting hero told to a generation who might otherwise never have known the legend of 'The Flying Sikh.'

Gangs of Wasseypur,Saibal Chatterjee,NDTV,7.0,2015-5-1,Rollicking and riotous aren't adjectives one normally associates with a gangster film. But that is precisely what Anurag Kashyap's Gangs of Wasseypur is.

Black,Jeffrey Chen,Window to the Movies,8.0,2008-10-8,"It's the details that make the whole thing work, from the performances ... to its deadly honest observations that Michelle's disabilities would create obstacles that would reach far beyond her loss of sight and hearing."
Black,Mark R. Leeper,rec.arts.movies.reviews,8.0,2007-5-15,"Bhansali built a visually beautiful film around the story of ""The Miracle Worker."" It is hard to imagine such an elegant and satisfying film coming from the Bollywood system."
Black,Liam Lacey,Globe and Mail,5.0,2005-2-4,
Batman Begins,Arnold Wayne Jones,Texas Triangle/TXT,8.75,2023-5-8,"The technical aspects are deft, especially the sound and cinematography... But what really works is how Gotham exists in a world apart from out own."
Batman Begins,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-3-21,"Batman Begins tansforms the superhero genre and transcends its limitations with a film that is a moving, emotionally involving, and exciting experience."
Batman Begins,Richard Crouse,Richard Crouse,6.0,2021-1-31,"Admirable in its emphasis on character over gadgetry, and is ambitious for a summer blockbuster, but for me, unfortunately it never quite takes flight."
Batman Begins,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,8.0,2020-9-25,"All in all, it definitely changes the course - for the better - of this formerly failing franchise."
Batman Begins,PJ Nabarro,One Room With A View,8.0,2020-6-9,"Batman Begins is certainly a worthy staging post in the inescapably compelling career of Christopher Nolan, and stands the test of time some 15 years after its release."
Batman Begins,Josh Wilding,ComicBookMovie.com,8.0,2020-2-15,"Batman Begins is easily one of the best films featuring the iconic DC Comics superhero, but far from perfect, despite telling what may just end up being the definitive big screen origin story for the Dark Knight."
Batman Begins,Danielle Solzman,Solzy at the Movies,10.0,2019-9-22,Christopher Nolan doesn't just reinvent the franchise for the big screen but Batman Begins takes the franchise back to its roots.
Batman Begins,Miles Fielder,The List,8.0,2019-4-24,"The film looks great and there some striking set-pieces, but in spite of a series of comic quips -- the new film lacks a sense of adventure and fun. Nevertheless, Nolan, Goyer and Bale have still managed to revitalize the ailing franchise."
Batman Begins,Namrata Joshi,Outlook,7.5,2019-1-8,"Batman has been all about darkness, Nolan just makes it a shade darker. Go see it."
A Beautiful Mind,Catherine Springer,CathsFilmForum.com,6.0,2021-7-26,Nash's character is perfectly suited to Crowe's ability to charm and confuse at the same moment.
A Beautiful Mind,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,4.0,2020-9-25,Its inspirational qualities to read more about the real John Nash (and all the things omitted from this biopic) might be the only lasting effect.
A Beautiful Mind,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,8.75,2020-9-2,"Howard's A Beautiful Mind works because it is not a film about mental illness, but a film about John Nash."
A Beautiful Mind,Tim Brayton,Alternate Ending,4.0,2019-2-24,"Profoundly, exhaustingly mediocre, a fussily overdone bit of mindless prestige filmmaking."
A Beautiful Mind,Dominic Bloch,Sky Cinema,10.0,2019-2-21,This is stirring and absorbing stuff.

A Beautiful Mind,Barry Paris,Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,8.75,2018-2-27,"You've gotta hand it to Howard. He and A Beautiful Mind got me (and I bet will get you) interested in this subject for the first time since ""new math"" ruined it for most of us in high school."
A Beautiful Mind,Chris Kaltenbach,Baltimore Sun,10.0,2014-2-4,A Beautiful Mind is the best film yet from director Howard.
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,8.75,2023-7-7,Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade closed the decade in style.
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,Tim Brayton,Alternate Ending,7.0,2023-7-5,"An awfully good and deliciously watchable popcorn movie, made by probably the single most reliable director of popcorn movies in the history of American cinema, when he was still pretty close to the peak of his powers."
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,Sebastian Zavala Kahn,Me gusta el cine,9.0,2023-7-1,"While the first instalment is a visceral and unexpectedly violent adventure, ""The Last Crusade"" is a gentler experience, more concerned with softening Indy's character through his relationship with his father. Full review in Spanish."
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,Roger Ebert,Chicago Sun-Times,8.75,2023-5-1,"As I watched it, I felt a real delight, because recent Hollywood escapist movies have become too jaded and cynical, and they have lost the feeling that you can stumble over astounding adventures just by going on a hike with your Scout troop."
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,Jack Garner,Rochester Democrat and Chronicle,8.0,2023-5-1,"River Phoenix, meanwhile, has a few marvelous moments as the adolescent Indiana Jones in the film's fabulous 16-minute prologue."
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,Richard Schickel,Video Review,10.0,2023-5-1,"I think this last installment in the popular series, made with the same care, conviction and energy as the first, but orchestrating the elements of a delicious formula at a still higher level of sophistication, may well be the best of his best."
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,Ron Larsen,Bay Area Reporter,8.75,2023-5-1,"Excesses notwithstanding, The Last Crusade’s debits are far outweighed by its credits. Chief among them is the film’s riveting 16-minute opening sequence, which serves as a combination prologue/prequel to the entire series."
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,Bruce R. Miller,Sioux City Journal,10.0,2023-5-1,"It's a shame that Spielberg and Ford say this is going to be the last Indiana Jones. There's so much life in this, the third installment, it could fuel several more."
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,Dennis King,Tulsa World,8.0,2023-5-1,verall it’s a cunning expertly made film that proves itself a lavish entertainment. Its mixture of blithe silliness and heart-racing action makes keeping up with the Jones a joyful and exhilarating experience.
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,Terry Lawson,Dayton Daily News,8.75,2023-5-1,"One of the things that made Raiders such a delight was the way he was able to recapture the B-movie thrills of the old-time serials in A-movie style, and The Last Crusade accomplishes that as well, as its two-hours-plus speed by in a breathless rush."
Die Hard,David Hogan,hoganreviews.co.uk,10.0,2022-12-24,"To say Die Hard still holds up is an understatement: charismatic protagonist and antagonist, great action set pieces, well paced and a top class finale. It’s no wonder so many other films and TV series continue to “do a Die Hard”, it’s still hard to top."
Die Hard,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-3-21,"The gold standard for action filmmaking; what action movie tropes Die Hard doesn't follow, it reinvents or altogether originates, and all of them have yet to be bettered."
Die Hard,Samuel R. Murrian,Parade Magazine,9.0,2021-11-16,"Sometimes-more often than not, even- a script with many hands on it becomes a case of too many cooks. With Die Hard, competing experienced creatives produced a film that works on multiple levels."
Die Hard,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,8.75,2021-8-29,"Still the prototype of the modern action yarn -- its status was secured so rapidly that subsequent action romps were invariably described as ""Die Hard on a train / plane / bus / zeppelin / tricycle / what-have-you."""
Die Hard,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,10.0,2020-9-6,"A spectacularly thrilling film, possessing enough brains to match its brawn."
Die Hard,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,10.0,2018-11-29,"It's a glorious scene-stealer for Alan Rickman, though it's a credit to Willis's cheeky charisma that his scene is not in fact stolen."
Die Hard,Niall Browne,Movies in Focus,10.0,2018-11-2,Die Hard is a great example of the Hollywood studio system getting moviemaking right - the film is a perfect storm of story and talent coming together.
Die Hard,Sean Mulvihill,FanboyNation.com,10.0,2018-10-30,Die Hard still feels as fresh and thrilling as the first time it screened.
Die Hard,Leigh Paatsch,Herald Sun (Australia),8.0,2018-7-12,"From the superb pacing through to the sarcastically sinister villainy of Alan Rickman, this remains a crucial template for the modern action film."
Ran,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,9.0,2020-9-7,An arresting amalgamation of unforgettable imagery.
Ran,Tara Brady,Irish Times,10.0,2016-8-8,One can never be short of things to look at while Kurasawa's Ran is in the world.
Ran,Joe Bendel,Epoch Times,10.0,2016-5-20,Ran is high classical tragedy several times over.

Ran,Jonathan Romney,Observer (UK),10.0,2016-4-3,A magisterial achievement.
Raging Bull,Dean Johnson,Orlando Sentinel,8.75,2023-10-11,"The brutality of Raging Bull is intense, a mood Scorsese maintains consistently. And, connected with that, is the director's search for, if not beauty, then poetry, within that vivid viciousness. He succeeds in that search."
Raging Bull,Joseph Gelmis,Newsday,7.5,2023-10-11,"De Niro playing La Motta in Raging Bull is beyond mere typecasting. It is an apotheosis. With La Motta as technical adviser, De Niro, an actor with a passion for authenticity, has found the ideal outlet for his singular talent."
Raging Bull,Gene Siskel,Chicago Tribune,10.0,2023-10-10,"If you like a movie down-and-dirty, Raging Bull is it. Filmed in black-and-white, and shockingly well acted by De Niro, Raging Bull suggests that if you are looking for the source of evil in the world, you don't have to look any further than yourself."
Raging Bull,John Stark,San Francisco Examiner,7.5,2023-10-10,"Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull is a technically brilliant piece of moviemaking that is often spellbinding. Something, however, is desperately missing, and that's a story with interesting people."
Stalker,Phil Hall,Daily-Reviews,0.0,2002-10-17,This film is so painfully awful that no pleasure can be found in criticizing it.
Sholay,Jimmy Cage,Jimmy Cage Movie Reviews (YouTube),8.0,2022-4-8,"Grand, mighty, iconic, monumental. SHOLAY is THE Indian epic that everyone must have seen."
Sholay,Sky Staff,Sky Cinema,8.0,2019-2-9,"A massively enjoyable movie, boasting a who's who of Indian legends."
Sholay,David Parkinson,Radio Times,8.0,2017-10-20,"The performances are impressive, especially that of Khan, who steals every scene he is in from his more famous co-stars."
Sholay,Saibal Chatterjee,NDTV,8.0,2017-10-20,"Yet, all these years later, the film remains a benchmark that commercial filmmakers in Mumbai can only aspire to match, let alone outstrip."
Sholay,Mark R. Leeper,Mark Leeper's Reviews,6.0,2016-4-18,Though it may seem uneven... parts of it are excellent.
Sholay,Dharmesh Rajput,BBC.com,10.0,2016-4-18,"It's a movie that you can watch again and again, and hardcore Bollywood fans do. But even if you just watch Sholay once, you won't be disappointed."
Monty Python and the Holy Grail,Sarah Cartland,Caution Spoilers,10.0,2024-4-5,"Doing for bunnies what Benchley and Spielberg did for Great Whites, Holy Grail is still a hoot - a meandering delight that also firmly skewers the genial pointlessness of quests and kingship, medieval myth-making, and much more."
Monty Python and the Holy Grail,Wesley Lovell,Cinema Sight,7.5,2022-11-23,Their film is a long-lasting tribute to comedic film history and one to be savored over and over again.
Monty Python and the Holy Grail,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,7.0,2020-8-30,"Some sketches are amusing, others are funny, and a rare few are altogether side-splitting."
Monty Python and the Holy Grail,Leigh Paatsch,Herald Sun (Australia),6.0,2020-4-15,"Worth a look if you've never seen it, but real fans know the best is yet to come."
Monty Python and the Holy Grail,John Lui,The Straits Times (Singapore),8.0,2020-4-2,"There are classic bits here about plagues, witches and chivalry, but their best scenes poke fun at ye olden days while stating that after 900 years, nothing has changed."
Monty Python and the Holy Grail,Donald Clarke,Irish Times,9.0,2018-9-13,The first non-sketch Python film is one of the great Arthurian romps.
Monty Python and the Holy Grail,Tim Brayton,Alternate Ending,9.0,2017-9-7,"Terribly exciting and clever, and while its sharpness has been considerably blunted through time, you can still tell where it once was."
Monty Python and the Holy Grail,Chris Barsanti,PopMatters,9.0,2015-12-2,"A fresh look at the ultimate mock epic, after the Python method has been assimilated into the cultural DNA, reveals the subversive spirit of this bloody and cynical Arthurian deconstruction."
Monty Python and the Holy Grail,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,10.0,2015-10-15,"The material is superb, Neil Innes' music is tremendous and Gilliam's animations are timelessly brilliant."
Monty Python and the Holy Grail,Tom Huddleston,Time Out,10.0,2015-10-13,"So unnecessarily gorgeous, there are moments where it feels like Tarkovsky with drag and farting."
Monty Python and the Holy Grail,Jamie Graham,Total Film,10.0,2013-11-18,The Python team's surreal take on the legend of Camelot bursts with inspired lunacy.
Monty Python and the Holy Grail,David Parkinson,Radio Times,8.0,2013-11-18,This remains a wonderfully inventive comedy that brilliantly debunks the Dark Ages and legends of chivalry.
The Great Escape,Danielle Solzman,Solzy at the Movies,10.0,2022-5-29,"Even though the filmmakers make changes to benefit an American audience, the memory of the 50 executed airmen will never be forgotten."
The Great Escape,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-2-17,"Somehow, The Great Escape manages to mourn the dead and uphold a unified sense of defiance in the same movement."
The Great Escape,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,9.0,2020-8-24,"The courageous, booming march by Elmer Bernstein that opens the picture is instantly one of the most memorable and notable pieces of music in cinema history."
The Great Escape,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,10.0,2020-5-16,"McQueen's thrilling motorcycle ride has long been the stuff of cinematic legend, but the movie is packed with countless memorable episodes of this caliber."
The Great Escape,Andrew Lowry,Total Film,8.0,2014-4-23,"Even if you feel you know every scene backwards, there are still manifold pleasures here beyond nostalgia."
The Great Escape,Kevin Carr,7M Pictures,8.0,2013-6-9,a slow burn which allows you to watch wildly different characters work together and form a team in spite of their differences
The Great Escape,Eric Melin,Scene-Stealers.com,7.5,2013-5-23,"Each group of characters get their own riveting planning sequences, all skillfully told. This is one ""heist"" film where knowing the details of how the escape is supposed to go down before it happens only strengthens the suspense further."
The Great Escape,Tim Brayton,Antagony & Ecstasy,9.0,2011-3-16,"A consummate work of nuts 'n bolts filmmaking devoted to the single end of creating something that is compulsively, endlessly watchable and re-watchable."

To Kill a Mockingbird,Matt Neal,ABC Radio (Australia),10.0,2020-9-15,"Atticus Finch is a film hero in a way we don't often think about - resilient, caring, empathetic, loving, dignified, and keen to make a better world."
To Kill a Mockingbird,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,9.0,2020-8-27,"Most of the film's distinction can be attributed to the story itself, which is so masterfully orchestrated that it's difficult not to be affected by the potency of its themes."
To Kill a Mockingbird,Andrew Collins,Radio Times,8.0,2016-2-28,"A fine, moving, informative period piece for all ages, To Kill a Mockingbird is as much an abiding favourite as the book."
To Kill a Mockingbird,Marc Lee,Daily Telegraph (UK),10.0,2015-2-3,"As Mulligan so deftly demonstrates, the story is in the characters, their failings and fragility, their heroism and nobility of spirit."
To Kill a Mockingbird,Kevin Carr,7M Pictures,7.0,2012-2-27,"I got so much more from this story as an adult, and it's a shame that my adolescent stubbornness kept me from the movie for so many years."
To Kill a Mockingbird,Eric Melin,Scene-Stealers.com,8.75,2012-2-11,"Because the story is related through young Scout and Jem, that childhood wonder and fear is never close behind."
Judgment at Nuremberg,Victor Pineyro,Seventh Art Studio,8.0,2022-4-8,"Few 3-hour long court dramas are as compelling and thrilling as Judgement at Nuremberg.

Judgment at Nuremberg,Pablo Villaça,Cinema em Cena,10.0,2009-2-6,"Abordando o complexo tema com honestidade, inteligência e humanidade, esta obra-prima repleta de atuações inesquecíveis é um atestado da capacidade do Cinema em servir não só como retrato de nossa História, mas como profunda reflexão sobre a mesma."

Dial M for Murder,Danielle Solzman,Solzy at the Movies,8.0,2023-1-3,Dial M for Murder is never short of suspense and the master of suspense's first of three films with Grace Kelly is among the top tier of Hitchcock's filmography.
Dial M for Murder,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-20,The story never trips over itself and Hitchcock let’s Knott’s script do most of the heavy lifting.
Dial M for Murder,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,9.0,2020-8-18,"Although the first act is where the franticness resides, the brilliance of the film is in the aftermath."
Dial M for Murder,PJ Nabarro,Patrick Nabarro,6.0,2019-10-31,"The film will mainly be of interest to Hitchcock aficionados and fans of '50s moviemaking - from the décor and costume, to the lovely use of Technicolor."
Dial M for Murder,David Keyes,Cinemaphile.org,7.5,2015-11-25,"The movie is worth seeing even now, if for no other aim than to show a man ambitiously experimenting with the devious facets that would inspire greater films."
Dial M for Murder,Tim Brayton,Antagony & Ecstasy,8.0,2014-7-5,An exercise made by an enormously talented constructor of thrillers in the most fertile period of his career.
Dial M for Murder,Jennie Kermode,Eye for Film,8.0,2013-8-19,The risk with clever thrillers is always that they will focus on pleasing the intellect at the expense of developing more depth. Dial M For Murder is a different kind of animal.
Dial M for Murder,David Parkinson,Radio Times,8.0,2013-7-26,"Milland's sinister sophistication catches the eye, but Kelly's subtly shaded suffering is superb."
Dial M for Murder,Charlotte O'Sullivan,London Evening Standard,6.0,2013-7-26,"Ray Milland is great as cold fish Tony Wendice, a former tennis pro who plans to bump off his adulterous wife. Still, Grace Kelly is mis-cast (or misdirected) as the spouse in question."
Dial M for Murder,Allan Hunter,Daily Express (UK),8.0,2013-7-25,"The depth of focus, framing of characters and objects and use of the claustrophobic sets add extra pleasure to what was already a thoroughly enjoyable ""perfect crime"" nail-biter."
Dial M for Murder,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,8.0,2013-7-25,"The set-up is ingenious and the ""kill"" scene genuinely thrilling."
Dial M for Murder,Nigel Andrews,Financial Times,8.0,2013-7-25,Grace Kelly reaches out into the audience for murder scissors; foreground tea tables all but clonk your knees; a tell-tale door key - how many Hitchcock revelation moments feature those! - is brandished inches from your nose.
Dial M for Murder,Matthew Thrift,Little White Lies,6.0,2013-7-25,"Second tier Hitch perhaps, but no less enjoyable for it, and still a marvel of cinematic technique."
Dial M for Murder,David Parkinson,Empire Magazine,6.0,2013-7-22,Despite Hitchcock's own reservations this is definitely worth a look. Interesting to his aficionados and darkly funny and depressing in turns.
Dial M for Murder,Emma Dibdin,Total Film,8.0,2013-7-16,"A tightly wound psychological parlour game, expanded only slightly from its claustrophobic stage roots."
To Be or Not to Be,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-2-23,"Throughout To Be or Not to Be, Lubitsch orchestrates a comic work of art whose central theme of acting offers perhaps the most accurate assessment of and staggering blow against the Nazi movement ever put to film."

To Be or Not to Be,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,10.0,2019-5-4,"A masterpiece. ... Hurtling forward with its dizzying blend of laughs and intrigue, the movie's blessed with a script that's jam-packed with memorable quips (some laced with naughty double entendres), with most of the best ones handed over to Benny."
To Be or Not to Be,Kate Cameron,New York Daily News,8.75,2018-1-18,"It isn't, I am sorry to say, Lubitsch's most intriguing comedy, nor is it the best of Jack Benny vehicles, but it will do until another buggy comes along."
To Be or Not to Be,Barbara Shulgasser,Common Sense Media,6.0,2017-6-27,Classic '40s anti-Nazi comedy has some violence.
To Be or Not to Be,Tim Brayton,Antagony & Ecstasy,8.0,2015-4-26,It's not all-time championship Lubitsch.... But the film is operating in two totally distinct comic modes and both of them are executed perfectly.
To Be or Not to Be,James Kendrick,Q Network Film Desk,10.0,2013-9-20,One of Lubitsch's greatest works and one of the most inventive anti-Nazi films to emerge from Hollywood.
To Be or Not to Be,Christopher Long,Movie Metropolis,8.0,2013-9-9,"Singing ""Heil pbbt!"" right in Der Fuehrer's face was certainly an act of resistance, and Lubitsch, Benny, Lombard, and company sure knew how to carry the tune."
To Be or Not to Be,Peter Canavese,Groucho Reviews,8.75,2013-9-3,"To Be or Not to Be has all the hallmarks of a Lubitsch comedy: a solidly constructed plot, good comic pacing, a light touch, and strong performances from top to bottom. [Blu-ray]"
To Be or Not to Be,Keith Phipps,The Dissolve,10.0,2013-8-27,"Lubitsch understood at the time, even if many critics and filmgoers didn't, that all those elements and all that rule-breaking make To Be Or Not To Be brilliant."
To Be or Not to Be,David Parkinson,Empire Magazine,10.0,2008-8-20,A masterpiece satire around the Second World War is more likely to be appreciated now after some distance.
The Gold Rush,Wesley Lovell,Cinema Sight,8.75,2023-10-5,The film captures the humor and the tragedy of one man’s life in the gold rush era and the end is inspirationally poetic.
The Gold Rush,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,10.0,2020-7-27,One of Charlie Chaplin's most endearing and popular works.
The Gold Rush,Michael J. Casey,Boulder Weekly,8.0,2020-6-30,Chaplin's greatest comedy is also his most recognizable.
The Gold Rush,Mattie Lucas,From the Front Row,8.75,2019-8-6,"Chaplin may have made better films during his career, but his unique charm remains just as timeless as ever."
The Gold Rush,Eric Melin,Kansas City Star,8.75,2012-9-4,"It shows Chaplin mixing slapstick with heartbreak like nobody else could. It's plotted in an episodic fashion, but each piece of the puzzle is also a memorable, entertaining bit in and of itself."
The Gold Rush,Matt Brunson,Creative Loafing,10.0,2012-7-13,No one can mix slapstick and sentimentality quite like Chaplin.
Portrait de la jeune fille en feu,Denise Pieniazek,Metacultura (AR),9.0,2023-12-28,"The film links several interesting themes: the role of women artists at that time, lesbianism, abortion, social canons and their hypocrisy. There are at least two aspects of the women painters that are well and correspond to historical facts."
Portrait de la jeune fille en feu,Dallas King,Flick Feast,10.0,2022-11-11,"Every artist begins with a blank canvas. It is what they do with it that defines them. With Portrait Of A Lady On Fire, Céline Sciamma has painted her masterpiece."
Portrait de la jeune fille en feu,Jane Freebury,The Canberra Times (Australia),10.0,2022-8-17,This intelligent and sensuous film is special. An intimate and delicate study of how two people can fall in love.
Portrait de la jeune fille en feu,Victor Pineyro,Seventh Art Studio,8.0,2022-6-23,"Every shot feels as if it was painted on a canvas. Love and romance are not the same thing, and it is subtly shown in this movie that surrounds the lack of freedom there is in secrets. [Full review in Spanish]"
Portrait de la jeune fille en feu,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-2-21,"It's a film that acknowledges the limits of reality even as Sciamma finds overriding freedom in her characters yearnings, making, as one character observes, not the lover's choice, but the poet's in telling this story."
Portrait de la jeune fille en feu,William Venegas,La Nación (Costa Rica),10.0,2021-12-8,The plot reveals itself with an assured poetic tone that never falters. [Full review in Spanish]
Portrait de la jeune fille en feu,Fernando E. Juan Lima,EscribiendoCine,6.0,2021-10-26,What works comes less from the script and more from the presence and power of the two beautiful protagonists. [Full Review in Spanish]
Portrait de la jeune fille en feu,Eddie Harrison,film-authority.com,8.0,2021-9-21,"...a sumptuous, haunting love story with moments of dynamism..."
Portrait de la jeune fille en feu,Ben Turner,The Pink Lens,8.0,2021-9-1,"While it says much about the female gaze - both as painter and painted, watcher and watched - that doesn't stop it from sagging in its final act."
Portrait de la jeune fille en feu,Laura Potier,Outtake Mag,10.0,2021-8-16,"[A] deconstruction of the male gaze, bringing forth a new lens through which to view women's agency and historic contributions to art... wrapped in a gentle yet painful love story."
Portrait de la jeune fille en feu,Milana Vujkov,Lola On Film,10.0,2021-7-31,"Unfolds as a liquid painting, shades of honey, earth, and time, with a soundtrack burning off all that is unnecessary."
Haider,Deepika Shetty,The Straits Times (Singapore),7.0,2015-5-13,"Using Hamlet as his inspiration, director Vishal Bharadwaj's new film finally does full justice to India's under-rated acting dynamos -- Kapoor and Tabu -- without trivialising the larger issue of Kashmir that forms the backdrop."
Haider,Srijana Mitra Das,The Times of India,8.0,2015-4-15,To see or not to see is no dilemma here.
Haider,Sweta Kaushal,Hindustan Times,8.0,2015-4-15,Vishal Bhardwaj's Haider goes where Bollywood rarely treads: the movie based on William Shakespeare's Hamlet goes beyond clichés on Kashmir and its characters aren't trying to be entertaining.
Haider,Anil Sinanan,Time Out,6.0,2015-4-15,"The result is a tense, well crafted drama that lacks the deep emotional intensity required in its disturbed characters."
Haider,Shubhra Gupta,The Indian Express,4.0,2015-4-15,"I doubt if I will be able to forget the stunning visuals which dot the film, but the sum is never more than its terrific parts."
Haider,Rahul Desai,Mumbai Mirror,6.0,2015-4-15,Tabu and Kay Kay Menon are enthralling to watch.
Haider,Sukanya Verma,Rediff.com,8.0,2015-4-15,"I found myself a little restless by its initial pace but Haider's deliberations are essential and, eventually, rewarding because it sensibly concerns itself beyond its titular man."
Haider,Mike McCahill,Guardian,6.0,2014-10-2,"A palpable hit, in any language."
Haider,Priya Joshi,Digital Spy,8.0,2014-10-2,This is exemplary cinema and a work of great artistic merit.
Relatos salvajes,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,7.5,2022-2-21,"Not every story will resonate, and the overall theme doesn't leave one with a sense of their combined profundity, but three or four stories are bound to feel familiar and thus deliciously watchable."
Relatos salvajes,Yasser Medina,Cinefilia,7.0,2020-6-26,"The thing is, the movie is entertaining, and it's contagious when it mocks the idiosyncrasies of a cynical civilization. [Full review in Spanish]"
Relatos salvajes,Karl Delossantos,Smash Cut Reviews,8.5,2019-8-8,"Damián Szifron tells each story with a specific visual flair that helps make ""Wild Tales"" the best anthology movie I've ever seen."
Relatos salvajes,Cameron Ward,One Room With A View,10.0,2019-5-14,Damián Szifron's deranged satire excels at every opportunity.
Relatos salvajes,Christine Jun,CineVue,6.0,2019-4-4,"Gleeful one-liners and frantic pacing aside, Wild Tales often feels less like real storytelling and more like superficial contrivances inflated by mechanized melodrama."
Relatos salvajes,Guillem Martinez Oya,Cinematismo,8.0,2019-1-20,A vision about desesperates human beings trying to razionalized their wildness. Six short and intense histories. A masterpiece. [Full review in Spanish]
Relatos salvajes,Josh Larsen,LarsenOnFilm,7.5,2017-9-18,...each segment gradually ratchets up until it becomes a visual demonstration of Murphy's Law.
Soul,Diego Batlle,Otroscines.com,8.0,2024-2-16,"While it's true that some themes such as ""the meaning of life"" could be inaccessible to younger viewers, Soul is also understood and works on a more basic level. [Full review in Spanish]"
Soul,Rolando Gallego,EscribiendoCine,6.0,2024-2-16,"Some luminous musical numbers, the protagonist's transformation, and the visualization of concepts such as lost souls, or “no-body” lift a movie that finds its driving force in the reiteration of ideas... [Full review in Spanish]"
Soul,Whelan Barzey,Time Out,6.0,2023-7-25,"If anything, Soul is guilty of over-ambition. The wizardry and wit are there, but it lacks Pixar’s usual deftness in making complex themes sing for youngsters."
Soul,Wesley Lovell,Cinema Sight,10.0,2022-11-26,"...it should help convince them that even if it’s not something they are great at, all they have to have is passion for its pursuit and that will be more than enough to satisfy their soul’s enrichment."
Soul,M.N. Miller,Ready Steady Cut,8.0,2022-9-9,"Soul is a thoughtful animated family film with a tender nature, some sweet laughs, and an even kinder heart."
Soul,Zoë Rose Bryant,Loud and Clear Reviews,8.0,2022-9-1,"Soul may not match the top-tier titles in Pixar’s formidable filmography, but this emotive exploration of human existence is just as engrossing all the same."
Soul,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,7.0,2022-8-25,"“Soul” is a heartfelt story about second chances and finding real purpose in your life. It’s about obsessions, mortality, and finding the true qualities that make each of us tick."
Soul,Daniel Howat,Next Best Picture,8.0,2022-5-20,"While there’s plenty of zany action, including talking animals and a body swap, Soul is one of Pixar’s quietest, most contemplative, and gentle films. And for anyone who has questioned why you’re here, this will pack an emotional punch."
Soul,Victoria Luxford,City AM,8.0,2022-2-28,"The film teeters on that fine line between genius and curiosity, going in directions that are unexpected even for a studio like Pixar. The film is confirmation that Pixar are still a company that do things their way, and that can only be a good thing."
Soul,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-2-17,"Beyond its sillier humorous notes and efficient, fast-paced explanations of complex worlds, Soul rewards contemplation."
Soul,Mat Brunet,AniMat's Review (YouTube),10.0,2022-2-16,"Soul is not just another masterpiece in the Pixar collection, but it is also the studios most thought-provoking and one of their most innovative features theyve made."
Soul,Jeffrey Harris,411mania,9.0,2022-2-14,"The film looks exceptional, the music sounds amazing, yet even with all the technical bells and whistles, Soul never forgets the emotional core and experience of its characters. It's a film that tells a story at a sensory level."
Kis Uykusu,Diego Batlle,Otroscines.com,8.0,2023-4-26,"Winter Sleep is a distressing and desolating story about class differences, religious conflicts in a society that's predominately Muslim, and the inner contradictions of those who propose political correctness... [Full review in Spanish]"
Kis Uykusu,Jordan M. Smith,IONCINEMA.com,6.0,2020-10-27,"There is great density within the richly spoken dialogue that endlessly flows throughout the film, but it's almost as if the ideas that flourish through spoken thoughts end up nearing drowning the purely cinematic aspects of the film."
Kis Uykusu,Yasser Medina,Cinefilia,7.0,2020-6-26,"Here we find not only a penetrating film [adapted from Anton Chekhov's work], but an epitome of loneliness and the human condition, as well as the moral questioning of good and evil that divides the social strata. [Full review in Spanish]"
Kis Uykusu,Ben Nicholson,CineVue,10.0,2019-4-3,"Ceylan's latest is a claustrophobic chamber piece spun out into a vast, rich and beautifully intricate tapestry."
Kis Uykusu,Jason Solomons,The Mail on Sunday (UK),6.0,2017-10-30,"It's a claustrophobic, bitter, terribly long movie that doesn't reward the viewer's heart or patience."
Kis Uykusu,Peter Calder,New Zealand Herald,9.0,2016-4-26,"The formidable running time will doubtless deter many, which is a shame: Winter Sleep is never less than richly engrossing, even if some scenes, stretched too long, take on a didactic, even slightly hectoring tone."
Kis Uykusu,Glenn Sumi,NOW Toronto,10.0,2015-12-18,"There's no melodrama in this film, only beautifully observed moments worthy of Chekhov and Bergman."
Kis Uykusu,Peter Keough,Boston Globe,10.0,2015-5-21,Such miserable people; why should we care? Maybe because Ceylan does.
Kis Uykusu,Rob Thomas,Madison Movie,7.5,2015-2-27,"""The length allows Ceylan to really sink into the characters and their complicated motives; at times, watching ""Winter Sleep"" is like reading a novel."""
Kis Uykusu,Ann Hornaday,Washington Post,10.0,2015-1-29,"The easy gag about the 196-minute ""Winter Sleep"" is that it's so good it makes 3  1/2 hours feel like two, but that's no joke."
PK,Anna M.M. Vetticad,annavetticadgoes2themovies,7.0,2022-8-15,"In the present atmosphere in India, it’s nothing short of bravery to openly discuss the failings of religion, and PK manages to do this in a highly entertaining fashion. This would not have been possible without the excellent cast headlined by Aamir..."
PK,Manjusha Radhakrishnan,Gulf News (UAE),7.0,2017-8-31,Watch this film if you are a Khan fan and want to learn a thing or two about religious tolerance without making it a bitter pill for viewers.
PK,Anil Sinanan,Time Out,8.0,2016-8-16,"The performances are pitch perfect, with A-lister Khan proving yet again that he's the most versatile and intelligent Indian actor of his generation. The result is probably the best mainstream Hindi film of 2014."
PK,Edmund Lee,South China Morning Post,7.0,2016-4-2,This entertaining Bollywood musical is so relentlessly buoyant in its charge to ask the big questions it comes close to reaching an epiphany.
PK,Christine Iyer,The National (UAE),8.0,2015-5-5,"Never preachy or high-handed, the filmmaker is an expert at presenting complicated concepts in the simplest of ways."
PK,Sapna Samant,"Flicks (AU, NZ, UK)",8.0,2015-4-8,P.K. is a landmark film that has come out at a relevant time in the current Indian and global political climate. Go see it and reflect on the difference between faith and religion.
PK,Rohit Vats,Hindustan Times,8.0,2015-4-8,"There are some very powerful scenes in the film that will make you cry, uneasy in seat, and even laugh sheepishly at times."
PK,Shubhra Gupta,The Indian Express,5.0,2015-4-8,"The focus... gets diluted by a wholly superfluous romance (and songs, tuneful as a couple are), and a face-off between the guy awash in goodness who asks all the right questions and the bad godman who has all the wrong answers."
PK,Rahul Desai,Mumbai Mirror,8.0,2015-4-8,"I can think of nobody but Aamir Khan as PK, and nobody but Rajkumar Hirani as our teacher."
PK,Srijana Mitra Das,The Times of India,8.0,2015-4-8,PK is as much a philosophy as a film.
PK,Saibal Chatterjee,NDTV,10.0,2015-4-8,"Rajkumar Hirani's first film in five years is a warm, funny and piercingly provocative satire that should blow the blues away."
The Grand Budapest Hotel,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,8.0,2022-8-21,It definitely comes more into focus the more times you see it.
The Grand Budapest Hotel,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-8-15,"Even from a single viewing, an audience knows they have seen what surely must be one of Anderson's best works to date."
The Grand Budapest Hotel,Calum Baker,Radio Times,10.0,2022-6-30,"Wes Anderson's bright, meticulous style reaches its most complete expression in this painfully poignant period comedy."
The Grand Budapest Hotel,Dan Bayer,Next Best Picture,8.0,2022-5-13,"Something this exciting to look at and listen to, something this light and entertaining, shouldn’t leave a viewer so unsatisfied."
The Grand Budapest Hotel,Therese Lacson,Nerdophiles,10.0,2021-10-9,It is a gorgeous movie; both comedic as well as emotional until the very last moment. Another great film by Anderson.
The Grand Budapest Hotel,Richard Crouse,Richard Crouse,9.0,2021-2-1,"Wes Anderson finds a balance between his highly stylized artistic vision, story and heart."
The Grand Budapest Hotel,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,9.0,2020-12-4,"No one crafts characters, worlds, and stories quite like Wes Anderson."
The Grand Budapest Hotel,Jordan M. Smith,IONCINEMA.com,8.0,2020-11-4,"The film's wholly fictionalized history and its meticulously composed imagery overlay the darkest thematic innards the filmmaker has yet composed, near-seamlessly melding its war-torn heart with a Mendl's sugary coating."
The Grand Budapest Hotel,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,10.0,2020-9-9,It is a film best experienced with a heart and mind fully open.
The Grand Budapest Hotel,Stephen A. Russell,The New Daily (Australia),9.0,2020-8-26,"There's a tantalising darkness just beneath the surface of Anderson's trademark whacky whimsy in his latest offering, The Grand Budapest Hotel, making it one of the year's most unforgettable films"
The Grand Budapest Hotel,Yasser Medina,Cinefilia,8.0,2020-6-25,"At 45 the Wes Anderson metaphor reaches its peak and is still more polymorphic than ever. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is another eccentricity of its world, where tragicomedy wraps itself of dreams without the need to wake up. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Grand Budapest Hotel,Adam Kempenaar,Filmspotting,9.0,2020-5-30,"""Times have changed."" It's an elemental Wes Anderson lament..."
Gone Girl,Ezequiel Boetti,EscribiendoCine,8.0,2023-7-11,"The mystery won't let up. Because the movie and the book formulate deeper doubts that, free from the boundaries of a procedural, allow us to generate (bitter) reflections on conjugal love. [Full review in Spanish]"
Gone Girl,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,8.0,2022-8-21,The visual presentation is moody and comfortless yet perfectly appropriate. And the music from Fincher favorites Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor creates atmospheres of tension.
Gone Girl,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-7-18,"More than the poetry of misdirection, more than disappearances or curdling doubt, more than sinister motives or cunning manipulation, and more shocking than a singularly violent, bloody death, David Fincher's Gone Girl is a portrait of marriage."
Gone Girl,Josh Parham,Next Best Picture,8.0,2022-5-27,"Employing crisp cinematography, atmospheric sound design, and an incredibly effective score, Fincher manages to utilize many of these crafts to create an engaging premise that sells an intriguing thematic insight."
Gone Girl,Dan Brightmore,NME (New Musical Express),9.0,2021-5-26,Fincher combines a maze-like plot with brutal drama to create an unmissable thriller.
Gone Girl,Richard Crouse,Richard Crouse,9.0,2021-2-2,"Not great art, but it is an artfully made potboiler with memorable performances and slick direction that will keep you guessing until the end."
Gone Girl,Leo Brady,AMovieGuy.com,10.0,2021-1-31,"Gone Girl not only entertains, but engages the viewer. This is one creepy masterpiece."
Gone Girl,Marianna Neal,Impression Blend,10.0,2021-1-3,Deliciously twisted!
Gone Girl,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,6.0,2020-12-4,Built with a masterful touch.
Gone Girl,Kelechi Ehenulo,Confessions From A Geek Mind,9.0,2020-7-15,"Watching Gone Girl was like watching Fatal Attraction, Misery and War of the Roses all wrapped up in one and yet you still couldn't get close to what this film was."
Hacksaw Ridge,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-21,"The superbly shot battle scenes aside, Gibson’s traditionalist sensibilities show up in how he shoots everything else which is a perfect fit for this particular film. It’s easy to get lost in the period he visualizes."
Hacksaw Ridge,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,6.25,2022-4-9,"Hacksaw Ridge seems at odds with itself, particularly during the chaotic and gruesome second half, as it tells a story about a brave pacifist while also satiating the filmmaker's long-demonstrated bloodlust."
Hacksaw Ridge,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,7.5,2021-11-13,"Mel Gibson's direction can hardly be deemed inspired, but because he's less ham-fisted in his jingoistic zeal than Peter Berg, his workmanlike efficiency at least rarely gets in the way of a worthy storyline."
Hacksaw Ridge,Leo Brady,AMovieGuy.com,7.5,2021-2-3,"Hacksaw Ridge sends us into the trenches, displays what one can achieve with faith, and honors the courageous character of Desmond Doss."
Hacksaw Ridge,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,7.0,2020-12-4,"It's as if Gibson wants to impart a message of peaceful religious convictions while also reenacting grisly, high-octane war moments."
Hacksaw Ridge,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,8.75,2020-9-10,Is Gibson glorifying the violence that Doss nearly gave his life to shun? Perhaps.
Hacksaw Ridge,Kelechi Ehenulo,Confessions From A Geek Mind,7.0,2020-7-17,Hacksaw Ridge has its heart in the right place but gets off to an uneven start and in some respects you could accuse this film as being Oscar bait.
Hacksaw Ridge,Yasser Medina,Cinefilia,7.0,2020-6-27,"We can say Gibson have returned to the violent historical drama for which his style has been characterized, but now he manages to catch us with a poignant anti-war film that talks about the horrors of war. [Full review in Spanish]"
Hacksaw Ridge,Nicholas Bell,IONCINEMA.com,4.0,2019-10-3,"Schmaltzy and hackneyed, despite some glaring bits of hard-won, gritty emotion."
Inside Out,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,1.25,2010-12-28,...a misguided and misbegotten endeavor through and through...
Inside Out,Erik Childress,eFilmCritic.com,2.5,2005-6-24,"This is a ridiculous, laughable thriller that will only sell extra tickets to those needing a laugh partner, since its no fun making sarcastic remarks to strangers."
Inside Out,Josh Bell,Las Vegas Weekly,4.0,2005-6-24,"Confusing and unsatisfying, held together only by some good performances by underrated TV veterans."
12 Years a Slave,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,8.0,2022-8-27,Piercing and heart-wrenching.
12 Years a Slave,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-8-22,"Unsettling and painful to behold, but from the lows of human civilization emerges a courageous and moving motion picture."
12 Years a Slave,Josh Parham,Next Best Picture,10.0,2022-5-27,McQueen's vision is one that articulates the overwhelming bleakness of this chapter of history while also recognizing the fleeting moments of emotional serenity that could oddly descend.
12 Years a Slave,Justin Brown,Medium Popcorn,10.0,2022-2-24,"A lot of the slave movies we see turn around and become a white savior movie, which this one avoided. Every element of this film is done so well and always has a deeply emotional impact on me. It is really captivating."
12 Years a Slave,Brandon Collins,Medium Popcorn,7.5,2022-2-24,"Steve McQueen did a masterful job of finding the balance between some heavy content while making it look visually stunning. The score, performances and cinematography was phenomenal."
12 Years a Slave,Catherine Springer,CathsFilmForum.com,8.0,2021-7-25,"It is a story that demanded to be told, demanded to be heard and it is absolutely perfectly done and deserves to be seen."
12 Years a Slave,Richard Crouse,Richard Crouse,9.0,2021-1-31,"A harrowing, stark movie that is equal parts educational and devastating."
12 Years a Slave,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,6.0,2020-12-3,"The subject matter lends itself to compelling stories, but the characters that suffer the worst injustices aren't the primary focus and receive no closure."
12 Years a Slave,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,10.0,2020-9-24,It seems impossible to think of anyone turning in as fine a performance as Ejiofor does here.
12 Years a Slave,Stephen A. Russell,The New Daily (Australia),10.0,2020-8-26,"It may have taken its time to daunder down under, garnering plenty of awards buzz behind it, but late January finally saw Steve McQueen's impeccably crafted slavery epic hit our shores, and boy was the eventual Best Picture Oscar-winner worth the wait."
Ford v Ferrari,Denise Pieniazek,Puesta en Escena (AR),8.5,2024-1-27,"It is a very solid film, which has both entertainment and emotion. Through an excellent script it will manage to keep the viewer expectant and intrigued. Its greatest success is that both car fans and non-car fans can really feel the adrenaline."
Ford v Ferrari,Victor Pineyro,Seventh Art Studio,8.0,2022-10-21,The best thing about Ford v Ferrari is how effective it is in injecting its adrenaline. Christian Bale is incredible in one of the movies with the most impressive sound design I've ever heard. [Full review in Spanish]
Ford v Ferrari,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,8.0,2022-8-20,...a rousing racing drama that doesn’t shirk on the human element.
Ford v Ferrari,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,8.75,2022-2-23,"Mangold transitions flawlessly into the period and subject matter, as one might expect. He's among our most talented journeymen directors."
Ford v Ferrari,Jeffrey Harris,411mania,9.0,2022-2-20,"James Mangold proves to be one of the better working directors in the business today with Ford v Ferrari. The film features an impeccable cast, led by an excellent performance by Christian Bale."
Ford v Ferrari,Taylor Baker,Drink in the Movies,8.0,2021-12-1,Episode 53: Honey Boy / Earthquake Bird / Ford v Ferrari
Ford v Ferrari,Nicholas Oon,Maximum Hype (YouTube),7.5,2021-9-5,"The sound design is almost flawless, and even if you're not a fan of racing movies, this one is for film lovers all over the planet."
Ford v Ferrari,Greg Wetherall,NME (New Musical Express),6.0,2021-6-14,"Like an unreliable car, Ford v Ferrari works only in spurts."
Ford v Ferrari,Tori Brazier,One Room With A View,7.0,2021-3-25,"Ultimately, Ford v Ferrari is an entertaining yarn, but possibly a movie that'll only make multiple laps around the track if you're a petrolhead."
Ford v Ferrari,Tony Black,Cultural Conversation,8.0,2021-2-16,"A thrilling, playful middle finger to corporate conservatism."
Ford v Ferrari,Alix Turner,Ready Steady Cut,6.0,2021-2-9,"Le Mans '66 is a polished film about a race to win, not about a race."
Kahaani,Anna M.M. Vetticad,annavetticadgoes2themovies,8.0,2021-1-26,[Kahaani's] woman-centricity goes way beyond the usual heroine-oriented Hindi film with the clearly spelt out focus on social issues!
Kahaani,Shubhra Gupta,The Indian Express,6.0,2019-3-27,"[Sujoy] Ghosh, who gave us a couple of trashy films after his sparkling debut, Jhankaar Beats, is back with a story with a strong sense of place and character."
Kahaani,Peter Galvin,sbs.com.au,6.0,2016-7-5,"The film, with its tough, intelligent femme hero, seems to be a wry rejoinder to the male-centered action of so much Bollywood and Hindi cinema. It's great fun."
Kahaani,Michael Dequina,TheMovieReport.com,7.5,2012-4-9,"Essentially a one-woman show for Vidya Balan, and what a show it is."
Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara,Sakhi Thirani,Common Sense Media,6.0,2023-9-13,"Yet with its sprinkling of silly humor the result is more a light-hearted fantasy film that shouldn't be taken too seriously, no matter how serious it takes itself."
Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara,Jimmy Cage,Jimmy Cage Movie Reviews (YouTube),7.0,2022-4-25,"ZINDAGI NA MILEGI DOBARA is a really nice feel-good film about friendship and the pleasures of life. Its not particularly deep, and its damn predictable  but the good cast and lively presentation easily top the few weaknesses."
Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara,Mayank Shekhar,Hindustan Times,8.0,2015-5-11,"What you take home are memorable, amusing moments of three truly adventurous amigos we've all grown up with."
Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara,Nikhat Kazmi,The Times of India,7.0,2015-5-11,"Rest assured, you're in for a merry ride, with loads of thrills, emotional banter, romance and camaraderie between a host of characters who seem to be having as much fun as you."
Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara,Shubhra Gupta,The Indian Express,4.0,2015-5-11,A good-looking but bland touristy delight.

Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara,Burl Burlingame,Honolulu Star-Advertiser,7.5,2012-1-12,"This is defiantly old-fashioned, high-value entertainment with a glamorous, talented cast. You used to see this sort of thing all the time from Hollywood."

A Wednesday,Namrata Joshi,Outlook,7.5,2019-1-30,"In a way, the film moves a step forward from where Rang De Basanti left. In a similar vein, it articulates the frustration and violence that has become deep-seated in the urban, middle-class psyche."
Gran Torino,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,8.75,2023-9-5,"Gran Torino is a nuanced picture with incredible heart, humor, and melodramatic themes of acceptance and long-overdue redemption."

Million Dollar Baby,Jeff Simon,Buffalo News,10.0,2018-2-27,"What moves you so powerfully at the end is not just a shattering tale of two old guys and a female boxer but, in our new millennium, a 74-year-old man's ability to tell it so powerfully without (apparently) the melancholy business of movies laying a glove"

Hotel Rwanda,Nick Rogers,Midwest Film Journal,10.0,2010-9-24,"Like ""Schindler's List,"" ""Hotel Rwanda"" shows how the madness of genocide and war converted one man's context of wealth and success from capitalism to humanitarianism. Don Cheadle honors Paul Rusesabagina by tapping his brave face and internal rage."
Hotel Rwanda,Jay Antani,Cinema Writer,3.75,2010-8-17,"potentially fantastic material...unfortunately, [Terry] George's attempt is too mired in movie-of-the-week sensibilities...to do any justice to its subject matter"

Before Sunset,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-19,"The conversations flow naturally – at first as if getting to know each other again, then later like two soulmates pouring their hearts out – and we never doubt that there is a real connection between these two characters."
Before Sunset,Nicholas Bell,IONCINEMA.com,7.0,2020-9-15,"This middle segment ends up being the least invigorating... Before Sunset feels a bit less substantial. Jesse and Celine play less easily off one another, their interactions clouded by adulthood, responsibility, etc."

Before Sunset,Nick Rogers,Midwest Film Journal,10.0,2010-9-25,"As a romance streaked with regrets, obligations and fears, ""Sunset"" builds to a wistful, perfect conclusion - a fadeout infused with the idea that a memory's never finished as long as you're alive and one of the loveliest last-line exchanges of all time."
Before Sunset,Dan Jardine,Cinemania,9.1,2010-1-17,"the film takes a miraculous healing turn at the end, and the characters rise above their ruefulness, and use it as a springboard into hope"

Finding Nemo,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,9.0,2020-9-29,"The visuals are as sharp as the scripting, succeeding with laughs, thrills, heartache, and unforgettable characterizations to craft an animated masterpiece."
Finding Nemo,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,7.5,2019-6-20,It's downright curmudgeonly to remain focused on the negatives when the rest of the picture is saturated with invention and wit.

Catch Me If You Can,John J. Puccio,Movie Metropolis,7.0,2012-11-28,"I don't think anyone would argue that 'Catch Me If You Can' is one of Spielberg's best films. However, it is good enough and passes a pleasant couple of hours."
Catch Me If You Can,Nell Minow,Common Sense Media,10.0,2010-12-22,Excellent account of FBI's youngest Most Wanted.

Amores perros,Andrea Beach,Common Sense Media,8.0,2017-9-29,Gripping but gory subtitled drama isn't for the squeamish.
Amores perros,Nick Rogers,Midwest Film Journal,10.0,2010-9-25,"Screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga and director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu exert such control over the story that even a cute doggie disappearance develops into a toilet-trained take on ""The Telltale Heart."" Warts and all, ""Amores Perros"" is love, actually."

The Big Lebowski,Mark Jackson,Epoch Times,8.0,2023-4-21,"Bridge's thespian mastery, via the slacker zeitgeist of our time, converts The Dude's funniest lines into a readily-understood language of everyday desperation. This ultimately begat the religion of Dudeism. Which makes 'Lebowski' an important movie."
The Big Lebowski,Adam Kempenaar,Filmspotting,10.0,2023-3-23,"25 years later, the movie where every detail matters and doesn’t matter at all, is as hilarious as ever – and more poignant, man."
The Big Lebowski,Stephen Silver,Tilt Magazine,10.0,2023-3-19,"The Coen Brothers introduced the world to The Dude, Jesus, Walter, Maude, and a fantasia of burnt-out ex-hippie in a Raymond Chandler plot. (25th anniversary)"
The Big Lebowski,Jeff Simon,Buffalo News,8.75,2023-1-24,"In American movies, the Coens are the reigning eccentric poets of the loser class. Who else could get away with quoting Theodore Herzl in a bowling alley?"
The Big Lebowski,Elvis Mitchell,Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com,8.0,2023-1-24,"A likably off-balance, screwball comedy mystery that cruises along so smoothly, and so quickly, you've got to pay attention. That's because Bridges' towering performance may divert your eye from the keen details."
The Big Lebowski,Alison Gillmor,Winnipeg Free Press,8.0,2023-1-24,"The Big Lebowski doesn't have [Fargo's] wholeness, but it does have absolutely perfect moments -- quirky details, darkly funny dialogue, indelible small parts."
The Big Lebowski,Carrie Rickey,Philadelphia Inquirer,6.25,2023-1-24,"It is a funny picture, in both the ha-ha and peculiar senses. And if it is not as fully fledged as Raising Arizona and Fargo, this is because the Coen Brothers set such high standards for their edgy comedies."
Trainspotting,Aaron Neuwirth,Why So Blu,10.0,2024-1-31,"This original spin through this specific moment in time continues to play as a high-energy display of wit, tragedy, and style in a manner that solidified so much for all involved."
Trainspotting,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-3-2,"The film resists a moralized discussion of drug use to instead presents a story whose ugly, darkly comic details pulse with Boyle's kinetic touch."
Trainspotting,Nicholas Oon,Maximum Hype (YouTube),8.3,2021-8-14,"The screenplay by John Hodge has this incredibly intoxicating eloquence to it, and despite being aimless addicts, most of the characters in this film have such strong personalities, it just makes them stand out."

Trainspotting,Wendy Ide,Observer (UK),8.0,2017-1-16,"What's interesting, viewing the film now, is how it manages to be both inarguably of its time, the mid 90s, but also has not dated nearly as badly as most youth culture movies tend to."
Trainspotting,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,10.0,2017-1-12,Trainspotting is supercharged with sulphurous humour and brutal recklessness: it charges at you like Ewan McGregor's Renton sprinting from store detectives in the opening sequence.
Trainspotting,Tim Brayton,Antagony & Ecstasy,9.0,2016-12-5,A showy balancing act.

Fargo,Kevin Maher,Times (UK),10.0,2021-6-14,"The North Dakota setting is icily evocative, the supporting characters perfectly pitched (remember Marge's old flame Mike Yanagita?), while the air of sadness that blankets the film like snow adds genuine profundity."
Fargo,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,10.0,2021-6-10,Its brilliance [lies] in making the forces of law and order look as interesting and funny as the bad guys.
Fargo,Danny Leigh,Financial Times,10.0,2021-6-9,"McDormand aside, the secret might be the perfect pitch of the black comedy, the two elements in rare harmony."

La haine,Alan Morrison,Empire Magazine,10.0,2023-7-20,"Stark, exquisite black-and-white photography drains what little cheer there is out of the concrete jungle, creating an alien cityscape devoid of sunshine. But Mathieu Kassovitz's triumph is in finding humanity in every single one of his characters."
La haine,Roger Ebert,Chicago Sun-Times,7.5,2023-7-20,"Hate is, I suppose, a Generation X film, whatever that means, but more mature and insightful than the American Gen X movies. In America, we cling to the notion that we have choice... In France, Kassovitz says, it is society that has made the choice."
La haine,Michael Wilmington,Chicago Tribune,8.75,2023-7-20,"Hate is a blast of movie outrage, a genuine shocker."
La haine,Rene Rodriguez,Miami Herald,8.75,2023-7-20,"What you remember most about Hate isn't its technique, but its powerhouse emotional punch: It's a stunner."
La haine,Ed Masley,Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,8.75,2023-7-20,"Hate is a grim, unsettling film with plenty to say and a fresh way of saying it."
La haine,Carrie Rickey,Philadelphia Inquirer,8.75,2023-7-20,"Rash as adolescence and urgent as its terse title, Hate is a total immersion in race and class war as played out over 24 hours in a Paris housing project."
La haine,Jack Mathews,Newsday,8.75,2023-7-20,"A powerful piece of sociopolitical filmmaking, and Kassovitz has established himself as the leading voice of the new consciousness in French film."

Before Sunrise,Nicholas Bell,IONCINEMA.com,8.0,2020-9-15,"Capturing an effervescent mixture of the mid-90s, it's a striking, authentic observation of two people experiencing a romantically charged connection which would come to erode and inform the shape of their future."
Before Sunrise,PJ Nabarro,Patrick Nabarro,10.0,2020-5-1,"What a film like Before Sunrise champions is that some of the most meaningful moments in our lives can be sensual and ephemeral: a look, a touch, a feeling, a few short hours."
Before Sunrise,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,7.5,2013-7-22,Undoubtedly one of the most romantic movies of all time...

Jurassic Park,Alan French,Sunshine State Cineplex,10.0,2023-6-11,"Watching the film in 2023 brings with it some unusual baggage. Questions about control, computer hacking, and what to do with the power you’ve discovered seem more relevant than ever."
Jurassic Park,Joe Lipsett,Horror Queers Podcast,10.0,2023-6-9,"Groundbreaking FX, an all star cast, some of the most iconic action/horror sequences ever filmed, and just the right amount of critique of traditional gender roles & capitalism. Jurassic Park truly is a four quadrant blockbuster"
Jurassic Park,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-22,“Jurassic Park” turned out to be an incredible visual achievement and a groundbreaking step forward for movie technology.
Jurassic Park,Wayne Broadway,Black Girl Nerds,10.0,2022-6-27,"'Jurassic Park' has staying power because it is not afraid to be about something while also maintaining its sense of the spectacular, that is, the sensory aspects of drama and filmmaking."
Jurassic Park,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-2-14,Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park uses marvelous visuals to suspend its audience and characters in awe and revelation.
Jurassic Park,Brandon Collins,Medium Popcorn,10.0,2021-6-25,This is a classic movie. The entire cast was great and Spielberg was in the zone on this one.
Jurassic Park,Justin Brown,Medium Popcorn,10.0,2021-6-25,This is a classic for good reason. It was a groundbreaking film that has magic that they haven't been able to recreate in this franchise.

Jurassic Park,Fico Cangiano,CineXpress Podcast,9.0,2020-5-24,"Almost 30 years since it was released, Jurassic Park remains one of the quintessential blockbuster films of all time. One of Steven Spielberg's best movies, gives us the perfect mix of wonder and terror. [Full review in Spanish]"

In the Name of the Father,Gene Siskel,Chicago Tribune,8.75,2014-2-28,Daniel Day-Lewis is remarkable.
In the Name of the Father,John Hartl,Seattle Times,8.75,2014-2-28,"At every point, Day-Lewis is at the center of the story, and he carries the film with an impassioned performance. It helps that it's a great part."
In the Name of the Father,Desmond Ryan,Philadelphia Inquirer,10.0,2014-2-28,"Day-Lewis, so intricately repressed in The Age of Innocence, here offers a role reversal in an unreserved and emotional performance that throws caution and inhibition to the winds."
In the Name of the Father,Jay Boyar,Orlando Sentinel,8.0,2014-2-28,The complicated relationship between the rebellious Gerry and the quietly tormented Giuseppe is one focus of the film. The obvious political implications of the dreadful situation are another.
In the Name of the Father,Sue Heal,Radio Times,8.0,2014-2-28,"This is a stirring and exceptionally well acted, though controversial, dramatisation of Gerry Conlon's book about the grave miscarriage of justice suffered by the Guildford Four."
In the Name of the Father,Kim Newman,Empire Magazine,8.0,2008-3-11,Letter-perfect performances from Day-Lewis and Postlethwaite do a lot more than a dozen editorials to make an unforgettable point about the miscarriage of justice.
Dead Poets Society,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,8.0,2022-8-20,"An Oscar-winning drama about self-discovery, free-thinking, and the unfortunate costs that sometimes comes with them."
Dead Poets Society,Kurt Jacobsen,Chicago Reader,2.5,2022-5-11,"We never are privy to Keatings’s personal life, nor do we quite grasp why such a talented individual is devoted to pedagogy."
Dead Poets Society,Mark Jackson,Epoch Times,7.0,2021-9-9,"I'd originally found it inspiring in 1989 but upon reviewing DPS in 2021, I've come to see it as the poster child (or movie poster) for the insidious, creeping way Hollywood helped sneak communism, Trojan-horse-wise, into America via the movies."
Dead Poets Society,Gene Siskel,Chicago Tribune,7.5,2017-8-23,A refreshing if obvious drama.
Dead Poets Society,Hank Gallo,New York Daily News,8.75,2016-6-1,"On the surface Robin Williams appears to be giving his standard performance as Prof. Keating - witty, sincere and lovable. But there's much more here."
Dead Poets Society,Josh Larsen,LarsenOnFilm,8.75,2014-8-18,I can't help but melt underneath this movie: it chisels away the cynic and gets at the sap.
Dead Poets Society,James Plath,Movie Metropolis,7.0,2012-1-9,"Williams keeps a stiff upper lip, showing a more sedate and sensitive side, and the Oscar-winning screenplay provides a strong backbone."
Dead Poets Society,Randy White,Common Sense Media,8.0,2011-1-2,"Inspiring, intense story of a teacher and his students."
Dead Poets Society,Angie Errigo,Empire Magazine,8.0,2010-8-24,Beautifully directed and with an Oscar-winning story.
Dead Poets Society,Rory L. Aronsky,Screen It!,9.0,2009-3-25,"Watch ""Dead Poets Society"" and you'll see the efforts of a filmmaker who has his own loving style in making movies."
Platoon,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,8.75,2022-10-11,Platoon may not be the best Vietnam war film ever made -- I still prefer both Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket by a healthy margin -- but I wouldn't care to argue with any veteran who states that it's the most honest depiction of that insane skirmish.
Platoon,Diane Haithman,Detroit Free Press,7.0,2022-8-23,"Despite the effectiveness of some of its moments, one begins to wish this movie were headed somewhere. Sensitive, intimate performances on the part of every member of a large ensemble cast, however, are enough to keep one watching."
Platoon,Michael H. Price,Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com,9.0,2022-8-23,Platoon marks the channeling of a zealot's rant into artistry of a high caliber.
Platoon,Bill Morrison,"News & Observer (Raleigh, NC)",10.0,2022-8-23,"The time for this film is now. And it deserves comparison with such great anti-war movies as All Quiet on the Western Front, Paths of Glory and Grand Illusion."
Platoon,Mike McGrady,Newsday,10.0,2022-8-23,"Platoon is brutal, vicious, surpassingly ugly -- in a word, realistic. It’s one of those movies that are hard to watch yet, impossible not to watch."
Platoon,Jack Garner,Rochester Democrat and Chronicle,10.0,2022-8-23,Platoon has the honesty and passion of a work that can only have sprung from experience -- and from the creator's needs to exercise the horrors of the past.
Platoon,George Williams,Sacramento Bee,10.0,2022-8-23,"[Platoon] looks like the real thing, feels like the real thing, sounds like the real thing. And the actors... have been ingeniously chosen for their roles -- they are so right."
Fitzcarraldo,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-20,"Much like the frazzled Fitz himself playing Caruso on his beaten up Victrola record player, we sense there is something special in the art we are consuming."
Fitzcarraldo,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-3-18,Few motion pictures have captured the frenzied power of obsession with as much veracity.
Fitzcarraldo,Yasser Medina,Cinefilia,7.0,2021-9-26,"A film that moves like a ship through the flow of a river, where Herzog acts as helmsman. [Full review in Spanish]"
Fitzcarraldo,Elliott Stein,Film Comment Magazine,2.5,2017-12-12,"This botched, shapeless, gratuitous, ignoble, neo-colonialist film is so poorly made, written, edited, and directed that its centerpiece, its raison d'tre -- the honest-to-God hauling of a boat up a mountain before your eyes -- is meaningless."
Fitzcarraldo,Josh Larsen,LarsenOnFilm,8.75,2017-8-26,...captures both the bravery and the danger of Fitzcarraldo's determination.
Fitzcarraldo,Dan Jardine,Cinemania,7.6,2014-7-30,Herzog's film confirms that dreamers and their obsessions can give us otherwise unimaginable moments of pure beauty.
Fitzcarraldo,Pablo Villaça,Cinema em Cena,10.0,2010-1-26,"A abordagem de imerso adotada por Herzog, somada  performance intensa de Kinski, resulta numa experincia nica e inesquecvel."
Fitzcarraldo,Cole Smithey,ColeSmithey.com,10.0,2007-9-13,

Fitzcarraldo,Emanuel Levy,EmanuelLevy.Com,10.0,2005-8-19,
Blade Runner,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-3-21,"Philip K. Dicks frequent exploration of perceived realities that begin to breakdown upon inspection, and thus define the fragile, shattered nature of existence and humanity, is brought to awe-inspiring life through Blade Runner."
Blade Runner,Peter Stack,San Francisco Examiner,5.0,2021-11-11,"A disjointed, implausible sci-film so trapped in photographic maneuvers that it's lifeless."
Blade Runner,Scott Cain,Atlanta Journal-Constitution,6.0,2021-11-9,"Ridley Scott ought to be a set decorator, rather than a director. In Blade Runner, he loses sight of the story while devoting all his attention to decor and lighting. The decor and lighting, it must be admitted, are stupendous."
Blade Runner,Fico Cangiano,CineXpress Podcast,9.0,2020-12-3,"Without a doubt a seminal film for the science fiction genre. Ahead of its time, Ridley Scott gave us a visually stunning, mind-bending and soul-searching masterpiece. [Full review in Spanish]"
Blade Runner,Jay Boyar,Buffalo Courier-Express,6.0,2020-9-4,"Everything, from the punkish clothing to the compact gadgetry, comments wittily on the present while also establishing a coherent future."
Blade Runner,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,10.0,2020-8-31,The set designs and overall look of the film are nothing short of inspired.
Blade Runner,Tom Meek,Cambridge Day,10.0,2020-4-6,"The score by Vangelis amplifies the emotion of every scene seamlessly, and enough can't be said about the production design by Lawrence G. Paull and visual effects by Douglas Trumbull."
The Deer Hunter,Romola Costantino,The Sun-Herald (Australia),7.5,2022-8-30,This unwieldy film batters its audience; perhaps this is the painful catharsis which American audiences want.
Network,Ian Kane,Epoch Times,9.0,2023-2-13,"“Network” is both a highly entertaining drama with lots of laugh-out-loud humor and a film that carries some very timely messages, ones that are extremely prescient in modern times."
Network,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-2-14,"In the war between cinema and television, Network remains an atomic bomb."
Network,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,6.25,2021-12-17,...an erratically-paced yet periodically spellbinding drama...
Network,Josh Larsen,LarsenOnFilm,10.0,2021-3-18,"""Faye Dunaway devours this movie."""
Network,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,9.0,2020-8-30,"Boasts an extremely intelligent script that is, in alternation, deliciously sardonic and depressingly sobering, with rapid-fire dialogue that congests every cynical exchange."
Network,Jennie Kermode,Eye for Film,7.0,2018-6-6,It deserves to be credited for [its] accuracy... and overall it's still great fun to watch.
Barry Lyndon,Kat Halstead,Common Sense Media,8.0,2023-10-11,"It's not laugh-out-loud funny, but there's a dry wit at play that adds a kind of comedy of manners element to the epic drama about a man at once casually unassuming but unwaveringly ambitious."
Barry Lyndon,Rachel Wagner,rachelsreviews.net,6.0,2022-5-15,"I can see why it won Oscars for score, costumes, art direction and cinematography. All of that is exemplary and very well done"
Barry Lyndon,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-2-23,"A film that best defines Kubrick's intellect, antisocial withdrawal, and obsessive tenure as a filmmaker, Barry Lyndon is also masterful, technically precise, and narratively complex."
Barry Lyndon,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,8.75,2021-9-22,"While many consider it brilliant, others find it about as exciting as folding socks."
Barry Lyndon,Nicholas Bell,IONCINEMA.com,8.0,2020-8-31,It is perhaps one of the most revolutionary examples of art-house auteur cinema before or since.
Barry Lyndon,James Kendrick,Q Network Film Desk,10.0,2019-3-20,"Barry Lyndon is a deeply felt, sometimes brutally ironic, and always visually gorgeous summation of the wide breadth of human experience."
Barry Lyndon,List Staff,The List,10.0,2019-3-20,"It's a stunning, sumptuous and sustained meditation on man's ultimate powerlessness."
Barry Lyndon,Donald Clarke,Irish Times,10.0,2019-3-20,"Barry Lyndon is, despite its rigorous construction, also among Kubrick's more emotionally engaged films."
Barry Lyndon,Michael Wilmington,Chicago Tribune,10.0,2019-2-4,"The wonderfully dry and witty narration is from Thackeray, delivered by Michael Horder."
Chinatown,Rosalyn Drexler,Vogue,7.5,2024-3-8,"A tremendously interesting movie to watch and to listen to. Roman Polanski, who directed, dredges up the dark slimy things that float beneath a sunlit surface."
Paper Moon,Josh Larsen,LarsenOnFilm,7.5,2023-2-8,Father and daughter are a delight when pulling a con together...
Paper Moon,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,8.75,2021-5-25,...grows more and more absorbing as it progresses...
Paper Moon,Gene Siskel,Chicago Tribune,8.75,2021-3-14,"It is distinguished by its moral tone, and it is the tone that lifts it above the average flim-flam comedy."
Paper Moon,Nathanael Hood,Unseen Films,9.0,2020-5-18,"O'Neal leaves a continent-sized impact crater in the center of the film, delivering an instantly iconic performance none have been able to replicate."
Paper Moon,Ian Mantgani,The Skinny,10.0,2015-6-3,"Sweet, playful, reverberant - this is a perfect movie."
Paper Moon,Wendy Ide,Times (UK),10.0,2015-5-14,"Part of an incredible 1970s career run for the director Peter Bogdanovich, Paper Moon remains a high point, not just for the talent involved behind the scenes and in front of the camera, but also for Hollywood."
Paper Moon,Wesley Lovell,Cinema Sight,8.75,2011-8-15,A cute little family drama about a young con artist and her father as they build a grifting empire.
Paper Moon,Christopher Lloyd,Sarasota Herald-Tribune,9.0,2011-1-17,"What's most interesting about Paper Moon is that it has the tone and timbre of a comedy, but the setting and style of the film are somber and more reminiscent of a European art film."
Paper Moon,Heather Boerner,Common Sense Media,8.0,2010-12-18,Tatum O'Neal's smoke- and booze-filled caper.
Solaris,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,8.0,2022-8-25,“Solaris” is a psychological thriller told through the stylistic lens of Soderbergh’s camera.
Solaris,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-3-14,"A rare, absorbing science-fiction tale that uses its actors, deceptively modest formal approach, and genre to sublime effect."
Solaris,Kat Halstead,Common Sense Media,6.0,2021-2-18,"Existential sci-fi drama has language, sex, adult themes."
Solaris,PJ Nabarro,One Room With A View,8.0,2018-12-15,"Whereas Tarkovsky's Solaris was a cerebral engagement with concepts of memory, relativity and Lacanian theory, Soderbergh's is a classy narrative piece - no more, no less."
Solaris,Kevin Carr,Fat Guys at the Movies,3.0,2016-1-10,"Solaris is just boring. It's dull. God, is it dull! Dull! Dull! Dull! Dull! Dull!"
Solaris,Sean Gandert,Paste Magazine,9.1,2011-6-4,...it remains a fascinating work and its deep questioning of what makes us human when faced with simulacrums feels if anything more relevant today than when it was made.
Solaris,Nick Rogers,Midwest Film Journal,8.75,2010-10-8,"Steven Soderbergh prunes Andrei Tartovsky's 1972 film (based on Stanislaw Lem's novel) to the clarity and concision of a great short story - a forlorn, philosophical sci-fi romance treading the terrain of ""Blade Runner's"" metaphysical melancholy."
Solaris,Mark Halverson,Sacramento News & Review,8.0,2008-8-7,"Steven Soderbergh's extremely sedate, Spartan science-fiction thriller and love story pits man's common sense and perceptions of a higher power against his own dreams and desires."
Solaris,Jeffrey M. Anderson,Combustible Celluloid,7.5,2008-3-21,"It's an unusual challenge for a Hollywood film with a major star, but worth the effort."
Solaris,Joe Lozito,Big Picture Big Sound,5.0,2007-7-14,"While Mr. Soderbergh's direction is always compelling, the whole film does not always equal the sum of its parts."
Solaris,Dan Jardine,Apollo Guide,8.4,2006-3-4,"fascinating, despite its flaws"
Solaris,Michael Dequina,Film Threat,9.0,2005-12-6,Soderbergh's Solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem.
Solaris,Rick Kisonak,Film Threat,8.0,2005-12-6,Soderbergh's latest may well leave Stanislaw Lem grumbling. My bet is virtually everyone else will be blown away.
Cool Hand Luke,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,8.75,2023-4-8,"In a career filled with iconic anti-heroes -- including what I deem the “4-H Club” from the 1960s (Hud, Harper, Hombre, and The Hustler) -- Lucas Jackson just might be the most popular of all the societal misfits played by Paul Newman."
Cool Hand Luke,Danielle Solzman,Solzy at the Movies,8.0,2023-4-4,Cool Hand Luke harkens back to an earlier era in Warner Bros. when they made gangster and chain gang films but this one is elevated by the likes of Paul Newman and George Kennedy.
Cool Hand Luke,Tom Meek,Cambridge Day,10.0,2021-1-23,"In my mind, the most defining role of Paul Newman's long, illustrious career, and one of the great antihero films told with cruel wit - a black comedy if ever there was one."
Cool Hand Luke,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,8.0,2020-8-24,"An archetype of '60s counterculture in cinema, particularly with its nuanced messages of discontent, conspicuous humor, and the unforgettable performance by Paul Newman."
Cool Hand Luke,Josh Larsen,LarsenOnFilm,10.0,2010-7-8,"...a gulag melodrama, if such a thing is possible."
Cool Hand Luke,Robert Levin,Critic's Notebook,8.0,2009-5-2,
Cool Hand Luke,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,7.5,2008-11-16,Anchored by Paul Newman's thoroughly magnetic performance...
Cool Hand Luke,Bill Weber,Slant Magazine,7.5,2008-9-9,"Newman remains watchable and glamorous throughout, bloody, muddy or coated in torso-flattering sweat, but the film's efforts to sentimentally ""humanize"" him by psychological revelation are clumsy."
Cool Hand Luke,Chris Cabin,Filmcritic.com,8.0,2008-9-5,The lines and the character have survived the film's oft-forgotten actual message.
Cool Hand Luke,John J. Puccio,Movie Metropolis,10.0,2008-8-26,...most viewers will have little failure understanding the movie and its motives. They communicate brilliantly.
Persona,Kevin Maher,Times (UK),10.0,2023-7-14,"... A nifty, stylish and unforgettable hour and a half."
Persona,Josh Larsen,LarsenOnFilm,8.75,2023-3-1,"The quintessential, mid-century art film..."
Persona,Tim Brayton,Alternate Ending,10.0,2019-7-25,Completely exhausted the medium's potential in one staggering blaze of monochromatic glory.
Persona,Edward Porter,Sunday Times (UK),10.0,2018-1-3,"Whether the film's ambiguous meanings strike you as profound or overblown, there's greatness enough in its aesthetic marvels: the power of its performances, the beauty of its images and the deftness of its sudden shifts."
Persona,David Jenkins,Little White Lies,10.0,2018-1-2,Hardcore surrealism is rarely this enjoyable.
Persona,Geoffrey Macnab,Independent (UK),10.0,2017-12-27,It remains as mysterious and troubling now as it ever was.
Persona,Phil Hall,Film Threat,10.0,2014-8-8,"This is the ultimate celluloid Rorschach test, where the production refuses to offer a straightforward solution to the maze of thorny challenges."
Persona,Scott Tobias,The Dissolve,9.0,2014-4-7,"[...]Persona marks a radical break for Bergman, an acknowledgment up front of the illusion and fundamental artifice of making movies."
Persona,Eric Melin,Scene-Stealers.com,8.0,2014-3-22,"Persona probes the depths of the human psyche, even as it examines the ways in which people tell stories and create new realities. Its themes are timeless, and it still holds up today."
Andrei Rublev,Tom Meek,Cambridge Day,10.0,2020-8-7,"The film clocks in at more than three hours, but feels only half as long with themes of self, religion, art and freedom perforating each episode."
Andrei Rublev,Mattie Lucas,From the Front Row,10.0,2019-6-3,"The stark black and white imagery, accompanied by the hushed sound design with its wordless vocals and tolling bells, immerses us in a dream that feels at once sacred and profane."
Andrei Rublev,Nathanael Hood,The Retro Set,9.0,2018-12-29,...a sprawling historical biography that sought to connect a godless society with the medieval monasticism that defined them as a separate ethnocultural entity.
Andrei Rublev,Ray Pride,Newcity,10.0,2018-12-26,"Among the most startling movie scenes of them all, a climax that is visual, emotional, and the patient result of depicting process-craft and narrative alike-as tactile poetics of detail, gesture, mud, rain, fear and hope."
Andrei Rublev,PJ Nabarro,Patrick Nabarro,8.0,2018-10-31,What makes the film so powerful is how Tarkovsky's vision transcends the mere people politics of its frame to conjure an idea about Russian history and the transience of man.
Andrei Rublev,Nicholas Bell,IONCINEMA.com,8.0,2018-10-17,"May be one of the most impressive portraits of an artist ever committed to film, if mostly because it also transcends its subject as a masterful examination of medieval Russia."
Andrei Rublev,James Kendrick,Q Network Film Desk,8.75,2018-10-17,"a film of intense yearning that uses the medieval painter as a launching point for artistic and philosophical inquiry, which necessarily makes the film narratively disjointed and sometimes challenging to follow"
Andrei Rublev,John Bleasdale,CineVue,10.0,2016-7-11,It is one of the most profound and moving experiences that cinema has ever conveyed.
Andrei Rublev,Tim Brayton,Antagony & Ecstasy,10.0,2015-7-25,"If cinephilia has a literal holy text, to be referred to and examined in times of joy and stress and sorrow, it is this."
Sanjuro,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-3-18,"Among Kurosawa's most well-balanced films, Sanjuro resounds with equal parts artistic intent and sheer entertainment value."
Sanjuro,David Parkinson,Empire Magazine,8.0,2012-8-7,Satirical Samurai action of the highest order.
Sanjuro,Peter Canavese,Groucho Reviews,10.0,2010-3-28,"Rather than simply repeating the successful formula of Yojimbo, which incorporated humor but largely played it straight, Sanjuro flips the script for a largely comic action picture punctuated by a dark, rug-yanking conclusion. [Blu-ray]"

Ivanovo detstvo,Tim Brayton,Alternate Ending,8.0,2020-5-10,One of the greatest anti-war films of the 1960s.
Ivanovo detstvo,Mattie Lucas,From the Front Row,10.0,2019-8-6,"Remains one of the most remarkable debuts in all of cinema, and one of the most indelible portraits of war and childhood ever made."
Ivanovo detstvo,Christopher Machell,CineVue,10.0,2018-3-5,"The surrealism of Solaris, the spatial experimentation of Stalker, the psychological insight of Mirror, these are all visible if not fully developed in Ivan's Childhood."
Ivanovo detstvo,Stephen Kelly,Total Film,10.0,2017-1-2,"No one paints a stark landscape like Tarkovsky, but we're not just talking surface beauty; the director shows a rare understanding of the consequences of combat."
Ivanovo detstvo,Tom Birchenough,The Arts Desk,10.0,2016-5-25,The work in which the remarkable nature of [Tarkovsky's] talent first shone through.
Ivanovo detstvo,Geoffrey Macnab,Independent (UK),10.0,2016-5-19,Tarkovsky pays full attention to the squalor and pity of war but never loses his sense of poetry.
Ivanovo detstvo,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,10.0,2016-5-19,Unmissable.
Ivanovo detstvo,Tom Huddleston,Time Out,10.0,2016-5-16,No other director is simultaneously so precise and so otherworldly.
Ivanovo detstvo,Eric Melin,Scene-Stealers.com,7.5,2013-3-11,"Pairing [poetic] images with fragmented characters and Ivan's single-minded desire to get back in the fray, the result is disturbing and affecting."
Ivanovo detstvo,Ken Hanke,"Mountain Xpress (Asheville, NC)",9.0,2012-8-1,It feels stylistically as fresh as if it had been made yesterday -- even to some very striking use of handheld camerawork. It's really something of a masterpiece.
Ivanovo detstvo,Jeremiah Kipp,Slant Magazine,8.75,2007-7-27,"Even in this, his first feature, we see that Andrei Tarkovsky is compelled by memories of precious things."
Inherit the Wind,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,7.5,2021-9-18,Still relevant.
Inherit the Wind,Jordan M. Smith,IONCINEMA.com,9.0,2020-10-29,Kramer's film speaks volumes about how fear and ignorance still drive attempts to cage liberal thought and how we must stand up against such human rights violations.
Inherit the Wind,Christopher Machell,CineVue,10.0,2018-5-24,Stanley Kramer's 1960 film is a searing indictment of religious fundamentalism and anti-intellectualism. Inherit the Wind's relevance continues beyond its immediate parallels with McCarthyism.
Inherit the Wind,Ellen MacKay,Common Sense Media,10.0,2011-1-1,Knock-out courtroom drama has deft comic touches.

Inherit the Wind,Nell Minow,Movie Mom,10.0,2003-4-4,"Extraordinarly vivid, rich, and wise about the core questions of how we know and who we are."
On the Waterfront,Ed Potton,Times (UK),10.0,2024-4-5,"Malloy makes an unlikely proxy for Kazan, though. A former boxer with the eyes of a showgirl, he was the role of a lifetime for Brando, whose Method-schooled blend of machismo and vulnerability redefined acting for a generation."
On the Waterfront,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,10.0,2024-4-3,"The performances in the film have a magnificent intelligence and strength, shaped and guided incomparably by Kazan, a master of Broadway and Hollywood."
On the Waterfront,Ian Kane,Epoch Times,10.0,2021-12-27,"""On the Waterfront"" can be considered not only as one of the finest achievements in filmmaking, but also as Kazan's metaphor for standing up for what's right and calling out evil wherever one may find it."
On the Waterfront,James Wegg,JWR,8.0,2021-5-13,We're entitled to it
On the Waterfront,Janet Graves,Photoplay,10.0,2021-4-8,"Marlon Brando has a rewarding assignment in this smashing melodrama, full of the frightening sounds and sights of racket-haunted docks."
White Heat,Kate Cameron,New York Daily News,8.75,2024-4-23,"White Heat, made by Warners, under Raoul Walsh's direction and suggested by a Virginia Kellogg story, is a highly exciting cops and robbers melodrama. One scene of violence follows another, until the thrilling climax."
The Third Man,Roger Moore,Movie Nation,10.0,2024-1-20,The perfect thriller
The Third Man,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,10.0,2022-8-25,The story never hits a lull nor does it ever overplay it’s hand. It’s intelligent and well constructed and I was consumed by both the narrative and the environment in took place in.
The Third Man,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-3-21,"Reed remains the picture's greatest asset, even if he is not the first name that comes to mind when remembering The Third Man."
The Third Man,Matt Neal,Movies Ate My Life,10.0,2021-12-12,Welles' Harry Lime looms over the narrative just as the shadow of World War II looms over the film's post-war Vienna.
The Third Man,Cameron Meier,MeierMovies.com,10.0,2021-11-29,"It's often described as the best British-produced film ever made, and that's ... an understatement, as it's an easy addition to any ... list of the top 10 movies of all time."
The Third Man,Michael J. Casey,Michael J. Cinema,10.0,2021-9-8,Iconic.
The Third Man,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,10.0,2020-8-23,"As a mystery, it is average - but as a darkly artistic approach to intrigue, it's masterful."
The Third Man,Ed Potton,Times (UK),10.0,2019-9-8,"Seventy years on such sombreness seems timely, as does Harry Lime, Welles's deliciously elusive antihero."
The Third Man,Mark Feeney,Boston Globe,10.0,2015-8-6,"Krasker's camera reveals a dank, matte, defeated city - so dully vivid as to be a character unto itself - except that this Vienna becomes something altogether different seen at night or underground."
The Shop Around the Corner,Picture Parade,Motion Picture Magazine,8.75,2022-11-8,"Whether you are shopping for a movie or not, we urge you to drop in and take a look at The Shop Around the Corner."
The Shop Around the Corner,Kate Cameron,New York Daily News,8.75,2022-11-8,It is told in such a way as to warm the cockles of the heart and send the audience away from the theatre the better for having been permitted this intimate glimpse into the lives and loves of the personnel of the Matuschek store in Budapest.
Rebecca,M.N. Miller,Ready Steady Cut,5.0,2022-9-9,Maybe Mrs. Danvers was right. This Rebecca has us longing for the original.
Rebecca,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,8.0,2022-8-24,"It maintains a wonderful period feel thanks to Julian Day’s costumes and Katie Spencer’s set design. Laurie Rose’s stellar cinematography vividly captures the beautiful sun-soaked Monte Carlo as well as the gloomy, atmospheric Mandeley."
Rebecca,Victoria Luxford,City AM,4.0,2022-2-26,"Ben Wheatleys Rebecca really fails to distinguish itself, ending up another by-the-numbers remake to be lost in streaming queues."
Rebecca,David Gonzalez,The Cinematic Reel,6.0,2022-2-18,"While Rebecca will certainly not remove the sentiment from cinephiles wondering why a new remake was necessary, Wheatleys take surpasses the quality of the Psycho and Rear Window remakes."
Rebecca,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,5.0,2022-2-17,"Not only fails to live up to Hitchcocks classic, but it eschews much of the Gothic mood and atmosphere that distinguished the original book and film."
Rebecca,Milana Vujkov,Lola On Film,2.0,2021-7-31,"[Deconstructing] marriage, and the British class system, through rendering a classic, yet deeply subversive tale of passion, bondage, illness and jealousy entirely soulless."
Rebecca,Cassidy Olsen,Dig Boston,4.0,2021-2-28,"This new Rebecca, helmed by Ben Wheatley, is but an imitation of what Hollywood glamour and greatness looked like in 1940, produced by a studio that's in the midst of a long-term project to zombify that era."
Rebecca,Mark Meszoros,"The News-Herald (Willoughby, OH)",7.5,2021-2-15,"This Rebecca is a worthwhile blend of old and new, and it should be enough to tempt you to go to Manderley again."
Gone with the Wind,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-3-18,"It remains the most seen film in cinema history, not only because Selznick produced a monumental motion picture of immaculate quality, but because he knew how to sell it as an event."
Gone with the Wind,Tom Meek,Cambridge Day,7.5,2020-8-7,"One of the first technicolor films made by Hollywood, the panning shot of injured and dead soldiers littering a street remains unforgettable..."

Gone with the Wind,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,10.0,2020-7-27,"No other movie has had quite the impact, the influence, or the epic feel (perhaps as only a nearly four-hour-long production could create) of this unmistakable masterpiece."
Gone with the Wind,Matt Neal,ABC Radio (Australia),10.0,2020-5-12,"""Hey kids, wanna watch a four-hour-long romantic melodrama, told from the sympathetic perspective of the racist slave owners who lost the Civil War?"""

La Grande Illusion,Ernesto Diezmartinez,Cine Vértigo,10.0,2021-9-4,La grande illusion is a complex parquet of discourses that collide and complement each other. A masterpiece.
La Grande Illusion,Kevin Maher,Times (UK),10.0,2021-1-30,It's a smart choice and a peerless film that makes sweeping rhetorical statements about the futility of war while maintaining a laser-sharp focus on an ensemble of meticulously drawn characters.
La Grande Illusion,Josh Larsen,LarsenOnFilm,10.0,2014-9-6,"...highlights the absurdity of war, or possibly the absurdity of civilized behavior when war is going on just outside."
La Grande Illusion,Matt Brunson,Creative Loafing,10.0,2012-9-13,"Back in 1952, both Orson Welles and David Lean cited the movie as one of their 10 all-time favorite films. Still, not everyone was a fan: Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's rat-faced Minister of Propaganda, declared it ""Cinematic Public Enemy No. 1."""
La Grande Illusion,Kevin Carr,7M Pictures,8.0,2012-8-15,often contrasted to All Quiet on the Western Front which has a similar message but told with a very different perspective

La Grande Illusion,Kenneth Turan,Los Angeles Times,10.0,2012-5-17,"A model of simplicity and grace, with emotional effects that move you when you least expect it, the kind of great film that only a master can pull off."
La Grande Illusion,Stephen Garrett,Time Out,10.0,2012-5-8,"Funny, heart-wrenching, nail-biting, caustic and profound, touting the futility of armed combat while turning imprisonment and escape into a microcosm for society's aspirations and contradictions."

It Happened One Night,Victor Pineyro,Seventh Art Studio,6.0,2022-6-23,"The acting provides deceit, romance and comedy in a grandiose way. But it's inevitable to feel that time has gone by and through It Happened One Night's narrative efforts. [Full review in Spanish]"
It Happened One Night,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-3-13,"After nearly a century of critics, scholars, and moviegoers singing its praises, the answer to what makes the film endure remains simple, if rather dissatisfying: Movie Magic."
It Happened One Night,Matt Neal,ABC Radio (Australia),8.0,2021-10-25,"The quintessential pre-Code rom-com, laying out the template for a formula that exists to this day."
The Circus,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,9.0,2020-7-25,"Though not without striking qualities by itself, it serves best as a poignant stepping stone to the auteur's later, more famous projects."
The Circus,Nathanael Hood,The Retro Set,9.0,2020-1-9,"...one of [Chaplin's] most unforgettable and melancholy films, one filled to the brim with unforgettable gags and set pieces."
The Circus,James Kendrick,Q Network Film Desk,7.5,2019-11-10,"while it is hardly Chaplin's best film, The Circus is packed with enough memorable moments, a few of which rank among Chaplin's greatest comic achievements, to stand firmly on its own"
The Circus,Mattie Lucas,From the Front Row,8.75,2019-10-16,A sad clown masterwork that masks its tears with a smile.
The Circus,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,8.75,2019-9-28,"Even if it doesn't quite match the immortal likes of Modern Times or City Lights, The Circus still registers as prime Chaplin."
The Circus,Josh Larsen,LarsenOnFilm,8.75,2019-3-19,...a meta-commentary on Chaplin's own comic genius.
The Circus,Chris Cabin,Filmcritic.com,8.0,2010-7-15,sort of B-grade alternative to City Lights
The Circus,Keith Uhlich,Time Out,10.0,2010-7-14,"There's an edge to The Circus that suggests a man gazing deep into the void, laughing at the darkness and urging us to do the same."
The Circus,Christian Blauvelt,Slant Magazine,10.0,2010-7-11,The Circus may be the film that most definitively silences critics who claim that Charlie Chaplin's movies aren't cinematic.
Badhaai ho,Jimmy Cage,Jimmy Cage Movie Reviews (YouTube),7.0,2023-5-5,BADHAAI HO is just a really lovable and enjoyable feel-good film with a great ensemble cast and a good mix blend of humor and drama.
Badhaai ho,Rahul Desai,Film Companion,7.0,2018-10-19,It's a testament to the art of casting that the film is allowed to hinge on an actress in the position to draw from her own fierce individuality and life experience in the face of similar odds.

Badhaai ho,Saibal Chatterjee,NDTV,7.0,2018-10-18,"Among the most impressive aspects of Badhaai Ho is the way the director harnesses the rest of the on-screen talent pool and makes every character, even the minor ones, count."

Airlift,Rahul Desai,CatchNews,7.0,2019-2-7,"It's one thing to identify these numbers. It's another to give these digits a human face - complete with a beating heart, and a language that everyone can understand."
Airlift,Srijana Mitra Das,The Times of India,8.0,2017-10-30,"Airlift features Akshay at his best -- based on real-life characters, there's little khiladi-wala swag in Akshay's performance and more mature control."
Airlift,Sweta Kaushal,Hindustan Times,7.0,2017-10-30,"Though an action-packed story, Airlift's strength lies in the turbulent emotions of people at the mercy of each other's generosity and self-preservation."
Airlift,Anil Sinanan,Time Out,8.0,2017-10-23,"'Bollywood' and 'realism' may not go hand in hand, but this is a worthy and largely successful attempt at meaningful commercial Hindi cinema."

Bajrangi Bhaijaan,Anna M.M. Vetticad,annavetticadgoes2themovies,6.0,2021-2-2,I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a Salman Khan film so much.
Bajrangi Bhaijaan,Priya Joshi,Digital Spy,8.0,2017-10-30,"The film goes for the emotional jugular, relentlessly pulling at your heartstrings until you can take no more, but there are also a lot of laughs that balance the proceedings and stops it being a full on crying fest."
Bajrangi Bhaijaan,Manjari Saxena,Gulf News (UAE),7.0,2017-10-30,"Despite good performances all around, it is Malhotra who plays Shahida alias Munni who steals the show."
Bajrangi Bhaijaan,Anupama Chopra,Hindustan Times,7.0,2017-1-9,"Bajrangi Bhaijaan is simplistic, occasionally silly, and tiringly over-stretched. It's also unashamedly manipulative. But it works."
Bajrangi Bhaijaan,Deepika Shetty,The Straits Times (Singapore),7.0,2016-5-25,"As far as stories go, this is simple enough. And in its very simplicity, Bajrangi Bhaijaan tugs at the heartstrings."
Bajrangi Bhaijaan,Abhinav Purohit,The National (UAE),6.0,2015-7-23,"With high expectations surrounding the film's release, it manages to deliver on most counts."
Bajrangi Bhaijaan,Mike McCahill,Guardian,6.0,2015-7-19,"It remains the kind of package perhaps only Bollywood could now pull together: a movie that feels calculated in its grand design, and yet which plays as wholly sincere and heartfelt on a scene-by-scene basis."
Bajrangi Bhaijaan,Shubhra Gupta,The Indian Express,5.0,2015-7-16,"Got an emotional jugular? Bajrangi Bhaijaan is coming for you, hammer and tongs."
Bajrangi Bhaijaan,Srijana Mitra Das,The Times of India,8.0,2015-7-16,"With Bajrangi, you meet a whole new Salman -- this is not the shirt-ripping, ab-flaunting, dialogue-maro-ing Khan but a simple, innocent and honest man, who fails, gets tricked and beaten up -- but [is] never shaken from his purpose."
Bajrangi Bhaijaan,Saibal Chatterjee,NDTV,5.0,2015-7-16,What Bajrangi Bhaijaan seeks to communicate is laudable in the current climate of distrust. Wish it hadn't made such heavy weather of the well-meaning exercise.
Bajrangi Bhaijaan,Sukanya Verma,Rediff.com,6.0,2015-7-16,"Even in its unmistakably masala tone, it firmly believes the desire for peace is universal and recommends being a hero. Or just human."
Bajrangi Bhaijaan,Rohit Vats,Hindustan Times,5.0,2015-7-16,Bajrangi Bhaijaan is totally dependent on Salman Khan's superstardom and he pulls it off provided you overlook his in-your-face 'bhai' act in some scenes.

La La Land,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-4-5,"La La Land may seem romantic and wistful, but from the opening sequence onward it balances reality and romance, the frustrating quality of every-day life and the false allure of Hollywood."
La La Land,David Gonzalez,The Cinematic Reel,10.0,2022-2-14,"When discussing the great musicals of all time, La La Land is a film that makes us dreamers remember that anything is possible. Not only can it be added to the list of greatest musicals ever made but to the top of any list as the best film of 2016."

La La Land,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,10.0,2021-8-17,"As effervescent as the finest bottle of champagne, La La Land is an intoxicating motion picture that should particularly please anyone whose heart skips a beat whenever Fred dances on the late show or Judy sings on TCM."

La La Land,Kelechi Ehenulo,Confessions From A Geek Mind,8.0,2020-7-17,"The clash of styles and ideas are collectively embraced. It's the balance of cheese meets whimsical. Romance meets heartbreak.

The Martian,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,8.0,2022-8-24,"This entertaining mixture of striking visuals and patient, methodical narrative has little in common with Scott’s past sci-fi experiences."

The Martian,Richard Crouse,Richard Crouse,8.0,2021-3-4,"A fun film, a space Western about the strength of the human spirit and the indomitable will. ""Interstellar"" tread similar thematic ground last year but did so without the humour, the cheesy 70's soundtrack or, most importantly, Matt Damon."

Wonder,Joe Lipsett,Hazel & Katniss & Harry & Starr Podcast,4.0,2022-6-3,"While the film's success has shone an important light on disability, the casting controversies, inability to let Auggie be a real person and inspiration porn messaging verge on insufferable.

Wonder,Karl Delossantos,Smash Cut Reviews,7.0,2019-8-5,"I don't want to say that if you didn't like Wonder, then you don't have a heart. But this is really one of those movies that can cheer anyone's day up."
Wonder,Mattie Lucas,From the Front Row,7.5,2019-6-4,"This could easily have been a cloying and sappy film, but it is a testament to Chbosky's skill as a director and screenwriter that it isn't."

Gully Boy,Anna M.M. Vetticad,Firstpost,8.0,2021-1-9,"For a film that is about protest music, Gully Boy is surprisingly quiet. ... it is is also one of the best films to emerge from the Hindi cinemascape in recent times."
Gully Boy,Shikhar Verma,High on Films,5.0,2019-9-26,"Akhtar - Who previously explored only rich lives, manages to give them characteristic situations that avoid turning them into caricatures. However, she never seems to get that exploring these lives don't call for exploiting them."
Gully Boy,Manjusha Radhakrishnan,Gulf News (UAE),7.0,2019-2-19,Gully Boy is a rhythmic blast with Singh soaring to superlative highs as an actor.
Gully Boy,Anjali Raguraman,The Straits Times (Singapore),8.0,2019-2-15,"But even with all the catchy music, and the presence of real-life Mumbai rappers in the film like Kaam Bhari and MC Altaf lending it credibility, the slickness of the Bollywood production dulls the rough edges of this story of struggle."
Gully Boy,Raja Sen,Hindustan Times,8.0,2019-2-15,"The knockout punch comes from MC Sher. With a name that means both big cat and couplet, Sher is played by Siddhant Chaturvedi with natural, easy ferocity."

Short Term 12,Karl Delossantos,Smash Cut Reviews,9.0,2020-6-5,"There's a tendency for movies like Short Term 12 to be overwrought or contrived in their handling of such a sensitive story. However, Cretton avoids the pitfalls of the genre by balancing out the story with an intense and masterfully deployed empathy."
Short Term 12,David Harris,Spectrum Culture,8.0,2019-11-20,"Short Term 12 races by with its brief running time, but its ambling plot works to reveal a naturalistic discovery of its characters."
Short Term 12,Christopher Preston,One Room With A View,8.0,2019-6-7,"Impeccably performed by the whole cast, Short Term 12 is an exhausting ride through every emotion possible."
Short Term 12,Bernard Boo,Way Too Indie,8.7,2019-4-15,Short Term 12 lives and breathes true reality onto the movie screen better than most documentaries can.

The Imitation Game,Benjamín Harguindey,EscribiendoCine,8.0,2024-3-1,"The movie goes beyond requiem thanks to Cumberbatch's performance, the supporting actors and the surprising intensity of a spy thriller set mainly in two rooms and a garage. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Imitation Game,Don Shanahan,Every Movie Has a Lesson,10.0,2023-9-4,"Call out the ""Oscar bait"" planning and intentional polish all you want, but you won't be seeing a bad film whatsoever.  You will be seeing a calculated crowd pleaser with perfect delivery, through and through."
The Imitation Game,Sofía Ochoa Rodríguez,En Filme,8.0,2022-11-23,The aftertaste is somewhat schizophrenic: the founder of one of the pillars of our time was both a hero and martyr. It's a riddle the film doesn't try to solve. [Full review in Spanish]
The Imitation Game,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,7.5,2022-7-18,The Imitation Game does a fine job of making Turing's life story accessible for mass consumption—arguably to a fault.
The Imitation Game,Ben Turner,The Pink Lens,8.0,2021-9-2,"With its focus on the internal struggle as significant as the code-breaking itself, it sets it apart from its Bletchley Park predecessor, the decidedly wet Enigma."
The Imitation Game,Richard Crouse,Richard Crouse,9.0,2021-2-2,"Supporting cast and period production values are top notch, but it's Cumberbatch who excels, peeling back the layers of Turing's enigmatic life."
The Imitation Game,Nicole Ackman,Next Best Picture,5.0,2021-1-30,"Unfortunately, the film suffers from a weak script that fails to properly educate the audience about Turing...and it also downplays Turing's homosexuality."
The Imitation Game,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,8.0,2020-12-4,"Manages a surmounting level of intrigue from both its deft performances and its shuffling narrative of past, present, and post-war events."
The Imitation Game,Nicholas Bell,IONCINEMA.com,6.0,2020-10-28,The accolades bestowed on this otherwise well mounted but incredibly milquetoast production is the political statement that the film simply does not have the courage to muster on its own.
The Imitation Game,Kelechi Ehenulo,Confessions From A Geek Mind,6.0,2020-7-15,"It's right that the film is recognised for its dramatic performances, in particular Benedict Cumberbatch who shines in the role as Alan Turing. But ultimately once it ends you may feel you've seen better movies."
The Imitation Game,Yasser Medina,Cinefilia,7.0,2020-6-26,"The curious thing about The Imitation Game, without falling into bombast, is that it breaks codes with the wonderful performance of Benedict Cumberbatch. [Full review in Spanish]"

The Imitation Game,Josh Goller,Spectrum Culture,7.5,2019-7-19,"Cumberbatch conveys tortured humanity behind the analytical façade, even if we also understand and even chuckle at how frustrating Turing could be to those working with him."
The Imitation Game,Mattie Lucas,"The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)",5.0,2019-7-5,"Restrained and tasteful in a very British sort of way, but it almost seems afraid to tackle its subject head on."
The Imitation Game,Danielle Davenport,One Room With A View,8.0,2019-6-15,"Gorgeously realised, engagingly witty and with great performances all around, The Imitation Game is engrossing and accomplished."
The Imitation Game,Alexa Dalby,Dog and Wolf,8.0,2019-6-4,Keira Knightley is cut-glass and surprisingly convincing as Joan Clark.
Guardians of the Galaxy,Allison Rose,FlickDirect,9.0,2023-8-4,"The Guardians' cast has teamed up for four different movies, so it's no surprise their chemistry on screen is undeniable."
Guardians of the Galaxy,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,6.0,2022-8-21,It’s not that the ending of “Guardians” doesn’t work. It just felt a bit generic and almost what I’m starting to expect out of every Marvel movie.
Guardians of the Galaxy,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,8.75,2022-8-5,Marvel and Gunn should be proud of what an unusual yet accessible a film they've made.
Guardians of the Galaxy,Therese Lacson,Nerdophiles,10.0,2021-10-9,"Absolutely stunning to look at, hilarious to watch, and never takes itself too seriously or gets dragged down in melodrama."
Guardians of the Galaxy,Lisa Wright,NME (New Musical Express),9.0,2021-6-16,The big screen version of this lesser-known Marvel comic is a hilarious curveball.
Guardians of the Galaxy,David Hogan,hoganreviews.co.uk,10.0,2021-5-6,"It's so rare to see a film so perfectly crafted and cast. Forget ""MCU films"" or ""Comic book films"", Guardians of the Galaxy is just a great film, period."
Guardians of the Galaxy,Richard Crouse,Richard Crouse,8.0,2021-2-1,"It's filled with one-liners, sight gags and funny moments that play off the more standard blockbuster-style action and battle scenes."
Guardians of the Galaxy,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,8.0,2020-12-4,"Contains all the excitement and adventure one would expect from a Marvel superhero movie, but the glue that holds this ragtag band of outlaws together is the humor."
Guardians of the Galaxy,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,8.75,2020-9-9,May not necessarily be the movie event of the Summer but it's very likely one of the best Marvel-based cinematic adventures yet.
Guardians of the Galaxy,Kelechi Ehenulo,Confessions From A Geek Mind,8.0,2020-7-16,Guardians of the Galaxy is great reminder that not all superhero comic book films have to be dark and moody.

Blade Runner 2049,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-3-17,"That Villeneuve achieves such a cerebral and even touching picture, while also accomplishing an uncommonly sublime production, marks Blade Runner 2049 as a landmark in the science-fiction genre."
Blade Runner 2049,Drew Dietsch,FANDOM,10.0,2021-12-29,"It's immaculately constructed, full of true wonder, and keeps you under its spell all the way to the very end. In some ways, Blade Runner 2049 even surpasses the original."
Blade Runner 2049,Olly Richards,NME (New Musical Express),10.0,2021-5-6,A new chapter. A triumph. A cinematic miracle.
Blade Runner 2049,Richard Crouse,Richard Crouse,8.0,2021-3-1,A skilfully made movie that works as a companion piece to Scott's film and as a detective mystery.

Blade Runner 2049,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,8.75,2020-9-3,A rather remarkable sequel.
Blade Runner 2049,Kelechi Ehenulo,Confessions From A Geek Mind,10.0,2020-8-26,Blade Runner 2049 is so visually poetic yet intelligently profound that it leaves a haunting linger if you've engaged with its concept enough.
Blade Runner 2049,Matt Cipolla,Film Monthly,7.0,2020-7-23,"Blade Runner 2049 can be aggravatingly sparse and sometimes bombastic, taking too much time to say what it wants to. When the pieces fall into place, however, it's spellbinding."
Blade Runner 2049,Yasser Medina,Cinefilia,8.0,2020-6-27,"Blade Runner 2049 is distilled science fiction, as intriguing and profound as the predecessor. [Full review in Spanish]"

Her,Erik Childress,The Friendship Dilemma Podcast,10.0,2023-10-13,"One of the more profound films ever made about loneliness, Spike Jonze's beautiful film has Scarlett Johansson's best performance in a narrative that reinvigorates the need for not just communication but the privilege of listening."
Her,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,6.0,2022-8-21,“Her” incorporates a familiar science-fiction concept into what is more or less a love story and relational study.
Her,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-8-19,"At once provocative and fragile, Jonze’s many-layered film leaves us with much to consider about how we love and whom we choose to love, and it leaves us reeling with pleasure over the amazing film he’s made."
Her,Danilo Castro,Next Best Picture,8.0,2022-5-17,"Few films have managed to capture all of the nuance and the hypocrisy of a breakup, much less the agonizing process of putting yourself back together."
Her,Fico Cangiano,CineXpress Podcast,9.0,2022-2-18,"A beautiful film that explores the relationship between humans and technology, and the fine line that pulls at each side. Spike Jonze delivers a profound exploration on the evolution of love and oneself. Full review in Spanish"
Her,Richard Crouse,Richard Crouse,8.0,2021-2-1,"An oddball story, but it's not an oddball film. It is ripe with real human emotion and commentary on a generation's reliance on technology at the cost of social interaction."
Her,Wesley Lovell,Cinema Sight,8.75,2020-12-16,"Spike Jonze has a brilliant eye for style and inventiveness, taking on a conventional quasi-futuristic narrative and giving it a heart and a philosophical message."

Bohemian Rhapsody,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,6.0,2022-8-19,You end up with a very safe and conventional biopic that aims more at being a crowd-pleaser than an in-depth character exploration.
Bohemian Rhapsody,Tom O'Brien,Next Best Picture,4.0,2022-6-14,"Queen was a group that broke down the rules for what a single or an album could be, and they deserved a movie that broke down the same barriers for movies, not this toothless wonder."
Bohemian Rhapsody,Victoria Luxford,BBC.com,6.0,2022-3-14,"Like many biopics, it's a bit glossy when it comes to the darker moments in (Freddie Mercury's) life. but the affection for the music and the great man is absolutely there.."
Bohemian Rhapsody,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,6.25,2022-3-8,"Bohemian Rhapsody alternates between an exceedingly bland dramatic shorthand about Queen and Mercury's life, and several long concert scenes that cannot help but enthuse the viewer."

Bohemian Rhapsody,Alix Turner,Ready Steady Cut,8.0,2021-2-2,"Bohemian Rhapsody tells the dramatised history of the influential British rock band, Queen, with the limelight focused firmly on the late frontman, Freddie Mercury."
Bohemian Rhapsody,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,8.0,2020-12-5,So forceful and enthusiastic that it's hard not to get caught up in the momentum and the impact of one of the most enduring groups in rock history.
Bohemian Rhapsody,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,3.75,2020-9-3,"The film never really strikes an original note, choosing instead to tap into all the biopic high notes."
The Perks of Being a Wallflower,José C. Donayre Guerrero,EscribiendoCine,8.0,2024-2-12,"A very lively film whose ending gives a sensation of leaving behind a youth that, although dramatic, love-filled and happy, is never permanent. [Full review in Spanish]"

The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Sarah Knight Adamson,Sarah's Backstage Pass,8.75,2020-1-22,"Filmed on location in Pittsburg, the setting is the 90s but the script is timeless. Some scenes are as visually compelling as the characters."

The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Patrick Gamble,CineVue,6.0,2019-2-5,"The film, much like its reclusive protagonist, manages to carve out its own identity amongst a sea of vapid imitators."
The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Jamie Neish,CineVue,8.0,2018-8-13,"A surprisingly spot-on directorial debut, cementing Chbosky's voice as one to be listened to. His directorial style compliments the material to a tee, and helps to deliver a film that's as earnest, heartfelt and charming as coming-of-age dramas get."
The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Emma Dibdin,The Arts Desk,8.0,2018-5-21,"Perks hits on a kind of universal nostalgia for the teenage years...without blunting the sharp, dark edges it simultaneously imparts."
The Help,Wesley Lovell,Cinema Sight,8.75,2023-10-10,"As a piece of entertainment, it works. As a historical document, its contents are too sanitized in an effort to avoid inflaming old tensions and that mutes its impact."
The Help,Nadia Dalimonte,Next Best Picture,7.0,2023-4-6,"While the narrative includes Black characters’ perspectives, the writing holds them at a distance, not providing more in-depth character development overall."
The Help,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,5.0,2023-3-9,"This is a film that will expose you to horrible truths about a not-too-distant past and, in the end, makes you laugh and feel like there’s a happy ending, except there isn’t one. Not really."
The Help,Mark Jackson,Epoch Times,7.0,2022-1-26,"""The Help"" will make you laugh, cry, and contemplate how far we've come as a society, how much has radically changed since the 1960s and, given our current racial climate, reflect on how much more progress we need."

The Help,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,8.75,2020-9-10,The Help works beautifully as an entertaining film about a troubling period in American history and the people who were impacted by it.
The Help,Katie Smith-Wong,Musings of Guitargalchina,8.0,2019-12-11,"Abruptly ending and slightly overlong it may be, the performances from the three female leads and the authenticity of the setting covers the cracks in an otherwise charming film."
The Help,Mattie Lucas,"The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)",7.5,2019-6-8,"A fun, satisfying and often quite moving summer movie for grown-ups."
The Help,Shubhra Gupta,The Indian Express,8.0,2019-3-29,"Yes it has drawn some criticism for not being authentic enough in depicting the painful disparity, but in putting rarely heard voices on screen and telling it in a story as regonisable as this, The Help deserves only praise."
The Help,Kelly Jane Torrance,Washington Examiner,6.0,2019-1-8,"There's a luscious attention to paid to period detail, with brightly colored frocks and subdued homes. Yet the film itself is rather black and white, keeping it from being an unalloyed artistic success."
The Help,Joseph Walsh,CineVue,6.0,2018-8-29,"The film has its moments of twee sentimentalism, but also resonates with a clear sense of poignancy, and is told in an accessible and hugely pleasurable way."
The Help,Anna Smith,metro.co.uk,8.0,2018-8-24,"The Help is a somewhat light-hearted take on the relations between black maids and their bosses in 1960s Mississippi, giving a simplified yet well-intended story of Kathryn Stockettâ€™s novel for the big screen."
The Help,Brandy McDonnell,The Oklahoman,8.75,2018-8-8,"""The Help"" still serves as an uplifting reminder of how compassion, courage, empathy and honesty have helped change the world."
Deadpool,Don Shanahan,Every Movie Has a Lesson,10.0,2024-4-7,"""Deadpool"" is the most red-faced and side-splitting movie of the comic genre to date.  It makes ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" look like C-SPAN when it comes to non-stop action and humor."
Deadpool,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,8.75,2022-4-22,That Deadpool was ever made is something of a small miracle. That it's satisfying from a fan perspective is another miracle.

Deadpool,Richard Crouse,Richard Crouse,8.0,2021-2-3,"It's occasionally a little too rude and crude, bloody and bowed for it's own good but at least it tries to do something a little different in the well-worn context of the superhero genre."
Deadpool,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,7.0,2020-12-4,"Goes to great lengths to distance itself from the pack of recent Marvel entities, which have become more or less interchangeable."
Deadpool,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,8.75,2020-9-5,A terrific directing debut from Tim Miller that pretty much awards him a throne made of golden jockstraps on the wings of Stan Lee.
Deadpool,Yasser Medina,Cinefilia,7.0,2020-6-26,"It bets on violent action and the most twisted dark humor that's been seen in any Marvel movie, of course, with Ryan Reynolds' wild role as Deadpool. [Full review in Spanish]"
Deadpool,Katie Smith-Wong,Flick Feast,8.0,2019-11-18,"Coupled with the action-packed fight scenes, Deadpool proves he is here to entertain and he spectacularly does so, thanks to Reynolds' quick-witted performance."
Darbareye Elly,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-19,“About Elly” is a near hypnotic experience whether it’s the fascinating mystery akin to Antonioni’s brilliant “L’Avventura” or the stimulating character study/morality play that puts each character under a microscope.
Darbareye Elly,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,8.75,2022-2-20,"Farhadi peels back layer after layer of the story to heighten the dramatic stakes, gradually revealing his cultural commentary."
Darbareye Elly,Patrick Gamble,CineVue,8.0,2019-2-2,"Farhadi once again reveals himself to be a master of the morality tale, beautiful presenting a series of encounters in which each character is morally and ethically questioned."

Darbareye Elly,Anita Katz,San Francisco Examiner,8.75,2015-5-22,"Farahani, the standout among the cast, has a face Hollywood will soon be touting and can suffer on camera in ways the neorealists would have loved."

My Name Is Khan,Jimmy Cage,Jimmy Cage Movie Reviews (YouTube),7.0,2022-4-8,"MY NAME IS KHAN features a great Shahrukh Khan in the lead, who gives us a touching and very human portrait, without the special circumstances of his character distracting from the actual subject matter of the film."
My Name Is Khan,Nikhat Kazmi,The Times of India,8.0,2015-5-26,"The film is brimming over with scenes that relentlessly move you to tears, not because they are sad, but because they are uplifting, inspirational and just sometimes heart-rending."
My Name Is Khan,Shubhra Gupta,The Indian Express,8.0,2015-5-26,"The real bravery award should go to director-producer Karan Johar, who dispenses with the designer preciousness of his previous films to come as close as this to something real, something important."

Persepolis,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,8.75,2023-9-6,"It’s another important elevation of animation from children’s entertainment to pronounced, artistic cinema."
Persepolis,Mattie Lucas,From the Front Row,10.0,2019-7-6,"A masterful balancing of socially conscious drama, childhood memoir, and outright comedy, highlighting the absurdity of a culture ruled by petty fundamentalism."
Persepolis,Kaleem Aftab,The List,10.0,2018-11-4,Satrapi portrays a love of Iran without being revisionist or disguising any harsh truths about the regime. This is an exceptional and exceptionally moving piece of animated filmmaking.

Persepolis,Ben Kenigsberg,Time Out Chicago,6.0,2012-2-16,"Marjane's outlook on events is always slightly skewed and caricatured, and the visuals keep Persepolis striking to the eye even during its less dramatically satisfying patches."
Persepolis,Thomas Caldwell,Cinema Autopsy,8.0,2010-7-6,"Extremely entertaining, often moving and an eye-opener to those of us who know little about Iran."

Dallas Buyers Club,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,7.5,2022-8-19,Vallée’s attempts to transform reality into a verité-styled exposé are degraded into a purely human interest story once McConaughey and Leto have finished showcasing their astounding ability to drop weight and hand themselves over to their characters.

Blood Diamond,Brian Webster,Apollo Guide,8.0,2007-5-13,"Exciting and compelling, but even more than that, it's a great acting showcase for Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou."

Sin City,David Sterritt,Christian Science Monitor,7.5,2013-4-14,The cast is excellent and the computer-generated visuals are consistently stunning. Too bad the narration sounds like a string of clichés from creaky old detective novels.
Sin City,Joshua Starnes,ComingSoon.net,9.0,2011-3-30,"Sin City is a lot of things, but most of all, it's fun. It may not be for everyone, but everyone should see it once anyway, just to find out if it's for them."

Ratatouille,Deirdre Swain,NOW Toronto,8.0,2015-8-3,"Ratatouille was written and directed by Brad Bird, the guy behind The Incredibles, and while his new movie isn't as brainy as that one, it has lots of lovely touches to appeal to parents as well as kids."

Cinderella Man,Miles Fielder,The List,6.0,2019-4-26,Even Howard and Goldsman's penchant for being over-sentimental doesn't scupper the emotional punch Braddock's story packs. That's largely down to Crowe's utterly convincing performance.

Cinderella Man,Kam Williams,Princeton Town Topics,8.75,2007-5-7,"A cross between Seabiscuit (because of the Depression) and Rocky (because of the sport), yet a fine enough film to stand on its own, even if the production falls short of both in terms of its emotional punch."

Donnie Darko,Rafael Paz,Butaca Ancha,8.0,2021-1-19,Kelly adds to this central theme another of the topics that is constantly manifested throughout his work: the possibilities of the divine and the guilt of knowing those designs while we are alive.
Donnie Darko,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,5.0,2020-9-29,Every ounce of creativity is met with an equal serving of disappointing nebulousness.
Donnie Darko,Erik Anderson,AwardsWatch,10.0,2020-4-7,"It's a dense, complicated and amazing amalgam of genres and influences that really defies any constraints."
Donnie Darko,PJ Nabarro,Patrick Nabarro,8.0,2018-11-12,"It's ultimately the piece's surprisingly sincere, compassionate edge which transmits the most."
Donnie Darko,Ray Pride,Newcity,9.0,2017-4-29,"The theatrical version is some kind of compacted masterpiece, hormonal, vital, dazed, blissfully unhinged... I'm too attached to Donnie Darko to worry over its wanton weirdness, its mix of concreteness and intangibility."
Donnie Darko,Kyle Aaronson,PopMatters,8.0,2017-4-6,"It remains an aesthetically filmed blend of off-beat comedy, mind-boggling sci-fi, and subjective storytelling that serves as a singular and timeless piece of cinema."

Donnie Darko,Nick Rogers,Midwest Film Journal,10.0,2010-9-25,"Maybe Richard Kelly's fate is to be the cult-film circuit's Michael Cimino. He has yet to match the mood or magnitude of his debut - a collision of time-travel sci-fi, commentary on '80s malaise and teen angst that's simultaneously witty and poignant."
Magnolia,Roger Ebert,Chicago Sun-Times,10.0,2023-7-15,"Magnolia is operatic in its ambition, a great, joyous leap into melodrama and coincidence, with ragged emotions, crimes and punishments, deathbed scenes, romantic dreams, generational turmoil and celestial intervention, all scored to insistent music."
Magnolia,Ann Hornaday,Baltimore Sun,7.5,2023-7-15,"While not as fully realized as Anderson's last movie, Boogie Nights, Magnolia is filmed with the same skillful abandon, and takes many more artistic risks... The result is a movie as fascinating for its flaws as for its considerable successes."

Magnolia,Dennis King,Tulsa World,10.0,2023-7-15,"It's perhaps the most profoundly sobering thought in [Magnolia] that in this era of cultural fragmentation and soulless isolation, the most powerful unifying element that binds us together is the hypnotic cobalt glow of television."
Magnolia,Nanciann Cherry,Toledo Blade,8.75,2023-7-15,What is exhilarating is that nothing can be taken for granted.
Magnolia,Joe Holleman,St. Louis Post-Dispatch,7.5,2023-7-14,"A personal drama and dark comedy of epic proportions, a visually exciting story of human emotion and cosmic circumstance. It is a compelling, innovative and sometimes brilliant work from director Paul Thomas Anderson. I just wish it were a better movie."

Dancer in the Dark,Nick Rogers,Midwest Film Journal,10.0,2010-9-25,"Habitually galling director Lars von Trier's musical is a black-swan genre rarity - a 1960s-set sledgehammer to Broadway and Hollywood's insistence on sunshiny endings in golden-era musicals about Nazis, murder and suicide."
Dancer in the Dark,Jim Lane,Sacramento News & Review,4.0,2008-8-7,

The Iron Giant,Matt Soergel,Florida Times-Union,8.75,2014-8-12,"This is sharp, sophisticated stuff, appreciated on different levels by both parents and children, and even those who are neither. The film has impish humor, great adventure and more than a few thrills."
Sling Blade,Wesley Lovell,Cinema Sight,8.75,2022-2-12,"With one feature film, an underutilized character actor emerged from relative obscurity to become one of the hottest properties in Hollywood. Although his career has had ups and downs since, its clear that a strong voice in cinema arrived..."

Groundhog Day,Roger Moore,Movie Nation,8.75,2023-4-23,Sublime
Groundhog Day,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,8.75,2023-1-14,Nothing suggested that this would gather steam over time and emerge as one of the most respected comedies of the past 30 years.
Groundhog Day,Peter Stack,San Francisco Chronicle,10.0,2023-1-11,"This delightful romantic comedy, directed by Harold Ramis, is rich in fantasy and unexpectedly funny twists."
Groundhog Day,Marylynn Uricchio,Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,7.5,2022-12-21,Groundhog Day is a Scrooge-like comedy that's surprisingly delightful. It poses a very interesting question: What would happen if every day were the same?
Groundhog Day,Joe Baltake,Sacramento Bee,10.0,2022-12-21,"There's a purity to Groundhog Day that we rarely see in movies... It's civilized, as well as the perfect entertainment of the moment."
Groundhog Day,Roger Hurlburt,South Florida Sun-Sentinel,8.75,2022-12-21,"This sweetly surrealist comedy is, arguably, Murray's most irresistible effort. Groundhog Day is a warm and rewarding story about reason, reckoning, and romance."
Groundhog Day,Bruce R. Miller,Sioux City Journal,7.5,2022-12-21,Director Harold Ramis handles the situation beautifully. A potentially silly premise takes on Capraesque qualities and delights.
Groundhog Day,Scott Rosenberg,San Francisco Examiner,7.5,2022-12-21,"Groundhog Day could have been a dull one-joke film, but Murray and Ramis make it work by doggedly pursuing the implications of their outlandish premise."
Groundhog Day,Robert W. Butler,Kansas City Star,7.5,2022-12-21,"This is without doubt the wittiest Bill Murray film ever, filled with verbal, physical and even thematic gags that satisfy on several levels simultaneously."
Groundhog Day,Rene Rodriguez,Miami Herald,6.25,2022-12-21,"Groundhog Day combines Saturday Night Live shtick with Twilight Zone weirdness, and when it works, it's hilarious... Two-thirds of the way through, however, Groundhog Day turns syrupy, ruining much of the fun."
Bound by Honor,Justin Brown,Medium Popcorn,8.0,2021-10-15,"It was very well rooted in reality, which is something we typically don't see in films like this. It was also rewarding to see things come full circle for our central characters."
Bound by Honor,Brandon Collins,Medium Popcorn,6.0,2021-10-15,This is a very long movie but the performances elevated the material. Damian Chapa tried his best to lead this but there were some poor acting choices he made that threatened to derail the seriousness of the film.
Bound by Honor,Emanuel Levy,EmanuelLevy.Com,4.0,2006-5-1,"When mainstream Hollywood tackles Hispanic-themed movies, such as this one, the results are usually disastrous. Though aiming at creating an authentic Hispanic street epic, the otherwise reliable Hackford has directed a diffues and cliche picture."
Bound by Honor,Linda Cook,"Quad City Times (Davenport, IA)",6.0,2004-4-6,

Bound by Honor,Bob Bloom,"Journal and Courier (Lafayette, IN)",6.0,2002-12-17,"Long, ambitious and uneven, but an interesting project."
Bound by Honor,Scott Weinberg,eFilmCritic.com,7.0,2002-7-26,"Flawed and perhaps a tad overlong, but pretty gripping all the same."
Bound by Honor,James Berardinelli,ReelViews,6.25,2000-1-1,
Bound by Honor,Robert Faires,Austin Chronicle,4.0,2000-1-1,
Bound by Honor,Roger Ebert,Chicago Sun-Times,5.0,2000-1-1,"Bound by Honor contains some effective performances, some moments of deeply felt truth, and a portrait of prison life that I assume is accurate. What seems to be missing is a clear idea of why the movie was made."
Aladdin,Serena Seghedoni,Loud and Clear Reviews,5.0,2023-11-2,"The original Aladdin had many flaws, but it was [...] full of heart. And, while Guy Ritchie's live action movie might be a better film in terms of special effects, dance routines and perhaps even structure, ""heart"" is exactly what it doesn't have."
Aladdin,Swara Salih,But Why Tho? A Geek Community,7.5,2023-1-17,Aladdin works when it focuses on its characters. The world it builds is nice and lavish but without authentic depth. That combined with the lack of wonder and mystery keeps this from being as revolutionary as it would have liked to be.
Aladdin,Eddie Harrison,film-authority.com,4.0,2022-12-27,…every element here is a pitiful downgrade on the original…
Aladdin,M.N. Miller,Ready Steady Cut,7.0,2022-8-20,"While Smith and Massoud do display some buddy chemistry, it’s Naomi Scott’s fierce performance as Jasmine that’s the real showstopper."
Aladdin,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,3.75,2022-3-3,The characters of Ritchie's film feel like they're trying to replicate better performances than they could ever hope to achieve.
Aladdin,David Gonzalez,The Cinematic Reel,7.5,2022-2-18,"Aladdin does not try to reinvent the wheel, but it made sure it didnt break it. The film is a welcomed addition to the Disney live-action library."
Aladdin,Michael J. Casey,Michael J. Cinema,4.0,2021-3-7,A movie loaded with missed opportunities.
Aladdin,Richard Crouse,Richard Crouse,4.0,2021-1-31,"Despite the updates and the pomp Aladdin feels underwhelming by the time the end credits roll. The songs frequently interrupt the flow of the story, creating a stop-and-go feel that sucks some of the film's momentum away."
Aladdin,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,5.0,2020-12-7,A fully computer-animated Abu is the first of many changes that furnish a hint of phoniness in a world that now demands a greater suspension of disbelief.
Aladdin,Charles Koplinski,Reel Talk with Chuck and Pam,7.5,2020-11-20,"Visually, this is a stunning feat along with incredible action stunts and choreography."
Aladdin,Andrew Gaudion,THN,6.0,2020-8-28,"Aladdin is much like its protagonist; flawed, a little clumsy, but ultimately quite winning; a diamond in the rough."
Dances with Wolves,Bruce R. Miller,Sioux City Journal,10.0,2022-11-8,"Dances With Wolves is Costner's crossroads. Amazingly, he emerges from it a better actor and an extremely good director."
Dances with Wolves,Stephen Hunter,Baltimore Sun,8.75,2022-11-8,"How much easier if the movie were crummy and could be dismissed. But, damn its smarmy soul, it's beautifully watchable, a return to the visual vernacular of the western epic and all its old-fashioned scenic values."
Dances with Wolves,Tom Gearhart,Toledo Blade,10.0,2022-11-8,"Magnificent. It's the only word to describe Kevin Costner's Dances with Wolves. An epic in the grand tradition, it is a movie of breathtaking sweep and noble aims, and the story it tells is at once stirring and heartfelt."
Dances with Wolves,Dann Gire,Chicago Daily Herald,7.5,2022-11-8,"At times, Dances with Wolves comes dangerously close to becoming a stodgy historical drama. And yet, deftly inserted humor and strategically placed heart-tugs keep Dances with Wolves in step. It's a bravura piece of [David] Lean filmmaking."
Dances with Wolves,Bob Fenster,Arizona Republic,10.0,2022-11-8,It's difficult for any actor to direct himself effectively. It's amazing when someone does it in an epic that turns out as fine as this tale of the Old West.
Dances with Wolves,Eleanor O'Sullivan,Asbury Park Press (NJ),7.5,2022-11-8,Dances with Wolves is a flawed but stunning film and a remarkable debut for first-time director Costner.
Dances with Wolves,Michael MacCambridge,Austin American-Statesman,8.75,2022-11-8,"Costner, always an underrated, charismatic actor, deserves his due: He set out to make a movie about an America long gone and American wounds too long forgotten. He has succeeded, grandly and gracefully."
Dances with Wolves,Lawrence Toppman,Charlotte Observer,7.5,2022-11-7,"The story has comfortable familiarity, like a once-heard fairy tale unfolding as we expect and desire. Yet Costner's direction makes it fresh."
Dances with Wolves,Kathy Huffhines,Detroit Free Press,9.0,2022-11-7,"Beginning with [a] kind of comically earnest freshness, Dances with Wolves stretches into an engaging, noble, epic vision worthy of filling a screen so wide it seems to literally sweep from sea to shining sea."
Dances with Wolves,Art Chapman,Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com,7.0,2022-11-7,It is a personal story played out in a wide-open setting. It has stunning action (especially a breathtaking buffalo hunt) and moments of serenity. But the one thing that sets this frontier story apart from the norm is its dignity.
Dances with Wolves,Malcolm Johnson,Hartford Courant,7.5,2022-11-7,"Whatever its flaws, however, this is a grand and caring film that every lover of the medium should see. It is admirable for many reasons including the madness of its conception and execution."
Dances with Wolves,Robert W. Butler,Kansas City Star,7.5,2022-11-7,"The cynic in everyone wants to dig in its heels and stubbornly resist. But on a purely emotional level, Costner’s directing debut is extremely satisfying."
Dances with Wolves,Michael D. Reid,"Victoria Times Colonist (B.C., Canada)",10.0,2022-11-3,"Dances with Wolves is a near-miraculous achievement on several fronts. Working from a screenplay by Michael Blake based on his book, Costner shows himself to be a masterful director who is equally at home behind and in front of the camera."
Do the Right Thing,Josh Parham,Next Best Picture,10.0,2022-5-25,"There is a reason this film has earned its rightful place as one of cinema's greatest endeavors, and there is nothing but respect and admiration for Spike Lee’s masterpiece."
Do the Right Thing,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-2-14,Do the Right Thing endures as an essential work of cultural introspection.
Do the Right Thing,Allison Rose,FlickDirect,9.0,2021-2-23,"Spike Lee, as a writer and director, speaks to and for a segment of the population."
Do the Right Thing,Peter Canavese,Celluloid Dreams,10.0,2021-2-16,Spike Lee's magnum opus -- a Stanley Kramer film on steroids. Easily on the best social issue films ever made. (4K HD Blu-ray review).
Do the Right Thing,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,8.75,2020-9-6,"The film is honest, realistic and wonderfully written and directed by Lee."
Do the Right Thing,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,7.0,2020-9-6,"A compelling, commanding picture that can't truly be approached with objectiveness."
Do the Right Thing,Nicholas Bell,IONCINEMA.com,10.0,2020-8-11,"A delectable time capsule of 1989 Brooklyn which is unfortunately as prescient as ever in its deliberation on rampant racism and police brutality, a formidable cast... makes for an unforgettable experience."
Do the Right Thing,Karl Delossantos,Smash Cut Reviews,10.0,2020-6-28,"Do the Right Thing is so much larger than its Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn setting. That small slice of street acts as a microcosm for the entire racial system in America-one that is still at work and even more prevalent today."
Do the Right Thing,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,8.75,2020-6-23,Filmmaker Lee delivers a somewhat overlong yet mostly engrossing drama...
Rain Man,James Kendrick,Q Network Film Desk,8.75,2023-10-8,"the pairing of Hoffman and Cruise was lightning in a bottle, although on the surface it seemed like an utterly incongruous pairing"
Rain Man,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,8.75,2023-6-17,The film is unusually unsentimental in its approach to potentially mawkish material.
Rain Man,Fico Cangiano,CineXpress Podcast,8.0,2023-2-19,"Hoffman delivers a top-notch performance, while Cruise is right there behind him, in this emotional, delightful, road-trip that explores human connection and the power of empathy. [Full review in Spanish]"
Rain Man,Andrew Sarris,Video Review,7.5,2022-8-8,"My own comparatively mixed reaction is conditioned by a reflex resistance to any movie that seems to exploit a mental or physical handicap for easy pathos... Having stated this reservation, I must confess that Rain Man had me close to tears."
Rain Man,Patrick Taggart,Austin American-Statesman,10.0,2022-8-4,Rain Man is regulated so well in its emotional and psychological currents that many viewers may not be conscious of how deeply involved they are until it is over.
Rain Man,Stephen Hunter,Baltimore Sun,8.75,2022-8-4,"Levinson, the lyric poet of fumble-tongued human groping, the ardent urgencies of the inexpressible, and the high comedy of people saying exactly what they don't mean, has found a subject that lets his highly specialized talents roar and soar."
Rain Man,Lou Lumenick,Bergen Record (New Jersey),7.5,2022-8-4,"Rain Man really belongs to Hoffman, whose precisely limned Raymond is in a class with his other amazing transformations in Tootsie, Little Big Man, and Midnight Cowboy. It really cries out to be seen rather than described."
Rain Man,Lawrence Toppman,Charlotte Observer,10.0,2022-8-4,"It's a rarity for big-studio, big-star Hollywood: a $20 million picture in which nobody's ego is showing."
Akira,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,8.75,2022-8-19,Such an extraordinary achievement demands to be seen and seen again for re-evaluation into its deeper relevance—and to be appreciated as a landmark not just of anime but of international cinema.
Akira,Jimmy Cage,Jimmy Cage Movie Reviews (YouTube),10.0,2022-4-25,"AKIRA is an audiovisual masterpiece that still blows me away after all these years. For two hours, the film takes us into a completely disrupted world in which destruction and ambivalence are omnipresent. A film you will never forget."
Akira,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,8.0,2020-10-8,Akira's strangeness is very startling and sometimes bewildering. But there is a thanatonic rapture to its vision of a whole world ending and being reborn as something else.
Akira,Rachel Wagner,Rotoscopers,9.5,2019-1-19,"It's dark and violent but, because it is so creative, it is a really fun experience. It's like Inception but way more trippy!"
Akira,Julio Vélez,Cine Premiere,10.0,2017-6-20,"It continues to show the best of the genre, almost 30 years later. It would be sacrilegious to give a different rating from PERFECT to AKIRA. [Full review in Spanish]"
Akira,Tim Brayton,Antagony & Ecstasy,8.0,2015-7-4,"Handsome and preposterously ambitious, and even its worst narrative missteps are a factor of that ambition."
Akira,David Jenkins,Little White Lies,8.0,2013-7-18,"While its typically convoluted sci-fi plotting and sprawling ensemble of characters occasionally lead it to border on the incoherent, it's hard not to be in awe of the giant hand-drawn cityscapes that make up the backdrop for the eye-popping action."
Akira,Dave Kehr,Chicago Tribune,5.0,2013-4-10,"Pounding away, it becomes monotonous."
Akira,Stephen Hunter,Baltimore Sun,7.5,2013-4-10,"[Akira] is a blast and a half, a twisted dystopian parable of violence and rock and roll, Japanese-style. It's Disney on PCP, mean, rotten, psychotic, but incredibly vivid."
Akira,Jeffrey M. Anderson,Common Sense Media,8.0,2013-3-15,Extremely violent classic introduced anime to Westerners.
Akira,Robbie Collin,News of the World,10.0,2011-6-25,"Plenty of superb recent blockbusters, including The Matrix, The Dark Knight, Minority Report, Dark City and Inception, are all in its debt - not to mention a fair number of shockers, like Star Wars Episode II and the most recent Resident Evil atrocity."
Akira,Derek Malcolm,London Evening Standard,8.0,2011-6-24,Put it up there with the most astonishing animated features ever made.
Akira,Phelim O'Neill,Guardian,10.0,2011-6-23,"Style and substance run neck and neck in this thrilling, bold landmark film that just refuses to become dated."
Akira,David Parkinson,Radio Times,8.0,2011-6-23,"The cityscapes are awesome, the camerawork is dizzying. If you're new to manga, prepare to be converted."
Akira,Rob Daniel,Sky Cinema,10.0,2011-6-22,Akira is pure concentrated cinematic excellence - accept no substitutes.
The Princess Bride,James Kendrick,Q Network Film Desk,10.0,2023-10-8,"a charming and utterly disarming swashbuckling fairy tale that is also a smart, funny satire of swashbuckling fairy tales"
The Princess Bride,Danielle Solzman,Solzy at the Movies,9.0,2023-9-13,The Princess Bride weaves several genres together and remains a classic film to this day.
The Princess Bride,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2023-4-6,Few films have ever walked the thin line between earnestness and irony so flawlessly.
The Princess Bride,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,10.0,2020-9-6,"As the picture practically spoofs the endeavors of Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn, it's also competent enough to craft its own identity as a swashbuckling thriller."
The Princess Bride,Nathanael Hood,The Retro Set,9.0,2018-12-29,...a lavish studio spectacle...
The Princess Bride,Leigh Paatsch,Herald Sun (Australia),9.0,2018-12-28,"One of the all-time great fantasy movies, channelling both a rollicking spirit of adventure and genuinely uplifting humour all ages can appreciate."
The Princess Bride,Neil Smith,Total Film,10.0,2017-12-9,It manages to be both tongue-in-cheek and achingly sincere.
The Princess Bride,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,10.0,2017-10-23,"It's an adventure which reaches back to golden-age Hollywood and the devil-may-care world of Douglas Fairbanks or Tyrone Power playing Zorro, or Errol Flynn playing Robin Hood."
Au revoir les enfants,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-19,"This autobiographical film is unquestionably Malle’s most personal project and its story is taken from actual events of his childhood. He wrote, produced, and directed this stirring film that grounds its storytelling in authenticity and in earned emotion."
Au revoir les enfants,Wally Hammond,Little White Lies,8.0,2015-1-29,"Not the director's best work, but far, far from being his worst either."
Au revoir les enfants,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,10.0,2015-1-28,Breathtakingly good.
Au revoir les enfants,Martyn Conterio,CineVue,10.0,2015-1-28,"Malle builds Au Revoir Les Enfants out of small but vivid details centred on the life of the boarder, and the daily rituals and routines experienced by Julien Quentin (Gaspard Manesse) and Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejt)."
Au revoir les enfants,Tom Huddleston,Time Out,8.0,2015-1-26,An ever-shifting balance of power is the film's greatest strength.
Au revoir les enfants,Tony McKibbin,The List,8.0,2015-1-26,"It was a story that, 'kept haunting me all these years,' Malle said, and it's likely to haunt the viewer a little also."
Au revoir les enfants,David Parkinson,Empire Magazine,8.0,2010-8-24,"Louis Malle, possibly at his best here. The drama is subtle but affecting."
Au revoir les enfants,Ken Hanke,"Mountain Xpress (Asheville, NC)",9.0,2006-9-13,Malle's approach is perfectly suited to the subject -- not in the least because his deliberate pacing conveys a child's sense of time.
Au revoir les enfants,Christopher Null,Filmcritic.com,8.0,2006-4-2,unquestionably Malle's most personal film and arguably his most powerful
The Terminator,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2024-3-1,"While Cameron would make better, more ambitious, and certainly more successful projects in the decades to come, none would feel so foundational to Cameron’s auteurism as The Terminator"
The Terminator,Brian Bisesi,Horror Movie Club Podcast,8.0,2024-2-7,"Despite its simple plot and uninspired dialogue, The Terminator is an otherwise well-oiled machine propelled forward by the strength of James Cameron’s direction, Stan Winston’s special effects, and Schwarzenegger’s terrifying performance."
The Terminator,Andrew Sarris,Video Review,7.5,2022-8-5,"This action flick has more than a few moments of intimacy, lyricism and tenderness as it confronts the bleak prospects for mankind from a matriarchal point of view."
The Terminator,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,9.0,2020-9-8,"Never has a role been so perfectly sculpted for the Austrian bodybuilder, who possesses a powerful screen presence with little more than his menacing silhouette."
The Terminator,Leigh Paatsch,Herald Sun (Australia),7.0,2020-5-12,"Though the production design is a bit flimsy at times, both the big ideas at work and director James Cameron's brilliance as a proactive, inventive filmmaker generate a powerful flow that cannot help but sweep viewers totally away."
The Terminator,Josh Larsen,LarsenOnFilm,7.5,2017-5-18,"Those nightmares we've all had about being chased by some relentless, unstoppable monster? This is the movie adaptation."
The Terminator,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,10.0,2015-6-25,Getting the extraordinary physical specimen of Arnold Schwarzenegger for the lead was a stroke of genius and a stroke of fortune. Each of his pecs is the size of a bull's flank.
The Terminator,Tom Huddleston,Time Out,10.0,2015-6-15,Damn close to perfect.
The Terminator,Nick Rogers,Midwest Film Journal,9.0,2014-10-30,"Cameron maintains the heedless, non sequitur pace of a nightmare without resorting to cheap tactics. The frights of these nightmares, those cracked reflections of reality, hardly feel manufactured or inauthentic. And neither does ""The Terminator."""
Gandhi,Dann Gire,Chicago Daily Herald,10.0,2022-7-19,"Gandhi is exactly what a great motion picture should be. It's uplifting, inspiring, enthralling, provocative, educational and entertaining."
Gandhi,Richard Christiansen,Chicago Tribune,7.5,2022-7-19,"The movie finally lacks the essential spark of artistry that illuminates the greatest of these epic biographies, Lawrence of Arabia. But in a naughty world, it is a good work nonetheless."
Gandhi,Elston Brooks,Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com,10.0,2022-7-19,"The truly epic film is with us once again in Gandhi, and with it comes an absolutely towering performance by British stage actor Ben Kingsley who makes a stunning film debut in the title role."
Gandhi,Terry Lawson,"The Journal-Herald (Dayton, OH)",10.0,2022-7-19,"Gandhi is portrayed by Ben Kingsley, who gives an uncanny and charismatic performance, and he is assisted by some of India's finest character actors."
Kagemusha,Kevin Maher,Times (UK),8.0,2021-3-13,Monumental.
Kagemusha,Dan Jardine,Cinemania,7.0,2014-12-27,"The film swings like a pendulum between stillness and action, an occasionally jarring mix of David Lean-like panoramas with intimate character study."
Kagemusha,Hank Sartin,Time Out,10.0,2011-11-18,
Kagemusha,Keith Uhlich,Time Out,6.0,2011-11-17,"At worst, the film is an empty vessel that places blind trust in affected stillness and symmetry. But Kagemusha quite often switches on a dime to more deep and meaningful textures."
Kagemusha,Eric Henderson,Slant Magazine,7.5,2009-8-21,"Kagemusha, much like the similarly overblown but handsomely mounted Lawrence of Arabia, is an epic with a cipher in its point position."
Kagemusha,Peter Canavese,Groucho Reviews,10.0,2009-8-5,A fine example of the Kurosawa style...precision of narrative in both scripting and imagistic storytelling... [Blu-ray]

Kagemusha,David Thomas,Filmcritic.com,7.0,2005-1-26,"Nakadai's performance as Kagemusha and Shingen is impressive, creating two distinct characters, one of whom eerily mimics the other"
Kagemusha,Roger Ebert,Chicago Sun-Times,10.0,2004-10-23,There are great images in this film.
Kagemusha,Robin Clifford,Reeling Reviews,8.0,2004-3-9,
Being There,Christopher Lloyd,The Film Yap,9.0,2022-5-30,Peter Sellers' last great performance came in this gently satiric look at the dawning mass media culture from the book by Jerzy Kosiński.
Being There,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,8.75,2022-5-24,Alternately lovely and lacerating.
Being There,Michael Clark,Epoch Times,9.0,2022-3-8,"Devoid of finger-wagging, bellicose tirades, or emotional manipulation, Being There is a scathing commentary on politics and the media that points out how patently easy is it to fool people, often with their own willful, enthusiastic participation."
Being There,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-2-14,"Among the sharpest of all satires, Being There, released in 1979, would be the last great film made by director Hal Ashby, who had the most extraordinary track record of any filmmaker of the 1970s."
Being There,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,9.0,2020-8-27,"The humor continues to surface, regularly generating laugh-out-loud bewilderment and crushing awkwardness."
Being There,Ed Potton,Times (UK),8.0,2020-1-17,"Gently directed by Hal Ashby, this satire of a ruling class in which nobody knows anything is almost plausible, and certainly topical."
Being There,Mattie Lucas,From the Front Row,10.0,2019-6-4,"Closed out the 1970's with a knowing smile, mourning that which was to come, and celebrating an unassuming antidote to the decade's increasing sense of materialism and political polarization."
Being There,Josh Larsen,LarsenOnFilm,7.5,2019-5-13,Sellers is funny in every moment; you just have to watch very closely.
Being There,Simon Miraudo,Quickflix,8.0,2014-10-20,"Even in a chilly movie like this, deaths have resonance (whether they're on camera, or off)."
Being There,Tom Hutchinson,Radio Times,8.0,2014-7-8,Hal Ashby's satirical parable on the way the USA surrenders itself to homespun evangelicalism gives Peter Sellers the role of a lifetime.
Annie Hall,Gene Siskel,Chicago Tribune,8.75,2022-8-26,No question about it: Annie Hall takes a whack at bright people in conflict. It's very serious about its comedy.
Jaws,Patrick Cavanaugh,The Wolfman Cometh,10.0,2023-9-24,"A miraculous achievement from all aspects, Spielberg weaves together drama, humor, adventure, and horror expertly and plays the audience like a fiddle. The main trio of stars are tremendous in their roles."
Jaws,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-2-23,A carefully composed and genuinely great piece of filmmaking Steven Spielberg accomplished through unimaginable circumstances.
Jaws,Niall Browne,Movies in Focus,10.0,2021-6-24,"Jaws may be Steven Spielberg's greatest achievement. Sure, Schindler's List may get more critical kudos and Indiana Jones may be more iconic - but Spielberg's 1975 adaptation of Peter Benchley's aquatic thriller is a masterpiece from start to finish."
Jaws,Fico Cangiano,CineXpress Podcast,10.0,2020-12-23,"The father of all blockbusters, Steven Spielberg's film is a masterpiece under and above water. To this date, still makes me scared of swimming in the sea. [Full review in Spanish]"
Jaws,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,10.0,2020-8-30,"It can be appreciated entirely for its extraordinary entertainment value, nail-biting suspense, sense of adventure, and old-fashioned Hitchcockian scare-tactics."
Jaws,Adam Kempenaar,Filmspotting,10.0,2020-6-19,"...more interesting is where the political and personal intersect... which fits nicely with what the movie as a whole does so well, mixing the horror and adventure with the personal."
Jaws,Allison Rose,FlickDirect,9.0,2020-6-1,"Jaws was just the beginning of an ever-amazing career for Spielberg and has left audiences with a number of quotable lines including the very popular, ""You're going to need a bigger boat""."
Jaws,Leigh Paatsch,Herald Sun (Australia),9.0,2020-4-16,"Master filmmaker Steven Spielberg doesn't show much of the most famous shark of all time, but you can always sense he's never far away."
Dog Day Afternoon,Todd Gilchrist,IGN Movies,8.0,2024-4-7,"[Pacino's] performance here is spectacular, and achieves a kind of nuance and complexity that few actors from his or any other generation have before or since achieved."
Young Frankenstein,Yasser Medina,Cinefilia,7.0,2021-11-12,It is a comedy in which Brooks takes some creative liberties when it comes to addressing Shelley's work and uses Frankenstein's monster to parody Universal's horror movies with a hilarious and quite entertaining tone. [Full review in Spanish]
Young Frankenstein,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,6.0,2020-12-7,"Though it's fueled by memorable moments of dippy lampooning, it also carries on a touch too long; it's quite funny but ultimately not as polished as it could be."
Young Frankenstein,Fico Cangiano,CineXpress Podcast,9.0,2020-10-5,They don't do comedies like this anymore. Gene Wilder's performance is one for the ages. [Full review in Spanish]
Young Frankenstein,Kelechi Ehenulo,Set the Tape,10.0,2020-7-14,"Young Frankenstein is sharply littered with slapstick humour, double entendre meanings and witty dialogue, thanks to the efforts of Wilder and Brooks."
Young Frankenstein,Adam Smith,Empire Magazine,8.0,2019-11-27,"What it demonstrates is that for spoof to work, the spoofers must have deep affection for the material out of which they are wringing the wee."
Young Frankenstein,Alan Jones,Radio Times,10.0,2019-11-27,"This loopy send-up of classic chiller clichés from Universal's monster heyday is one of director Mel Brooks's best comedies, and it's also one of the genre's most thorough and successful fright film parodies."
Young Frankenstein,Neil Smith,Total Film,8.0,2017-9-26,Well worth a watch.
Papillon,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,8.75,2022-2-12,"The film critiques a society, from French penal codes to the larger prison system, that openly endeavors to take away a man's resolve until he is nothing."
Papillon,Kevin Maher,Times (UK),8.0,2018-9-14,The narrative is epic and life-spanning...The locations are stunning...and the surreal touches...add to the sense of a highly original art-movie spectacular.
Papillon,Barbara Shulgasser,Common Sense Media,8.0,2018-8-28,"Classic prison-escape movie has intense peril, violence."
Papillon,David Parkinson,Radio Times,8.0,2015-9-23,But Dustin Hoffman produces a splendid depiction of cunning corruption that acts as a perfect balance to McQueen's superstar charisma.
Papillon,John J. Puccio,Movie Metropolis,7.0,2011-5-14,"The narrative unfolds slowly, but the two stars are compelling and cinematographer Fred Koenekamp's photography is striking."
The Exorcist,George M. Thomas,Akron Beacon Journal,10.0,2023-9-29,"This film's ponderings about the nature of good and evil still merit consideration today. It also features some wonderful performances from Ellen Burstyn, Jason Miller, Max von Sydow and, especially, a then pre-adolescent Linda Blair."
The Exorcist,Margaret A. McGurk,Cincinnati Enquirer,8.75,2023-9-29,"The movie moves at a pace that is unheard of today; a good hour and a quarter pass before the word ""exorcism"" is even mentioned. Yet it weaves a frightening spell right from the get-go."
The Exorcist,Robert W. Butler,Kansas City Star,7.5,2023-9-29,"The Exorcist remains an exceptionally well-made, thoughtful film, enacted by a first-rate cast and displaying an almost masterful interplay between the humdrum and the horrific."
The Exorcist,Terry Lawson,Detroit Free Press,10.0,2023-9-29,"Friedkin performed a similar alchemy to that of Francis Ford Coppola [with The Godfather]: He took a good, pulpy novel and turned it into a great, enduring movie."
The Exorcist,Rene Rodriguez,Miami Herald,8.75,2023-9-29,"Some parts are bound to be greeted by unintentional laughter today, the result of countless parodies over the years. Still, The Exorcist has lost none of its ability to invade your nightmares."
The Exorcist,Susan Wloszczyna,USA Today,8.75,2023-9-29,"The Exorcist has dated little, and its essential premise makes it still one of the most modern of horror films. The monster isn't lurking out there. It resides in us, even in the most banal vessel imaginable, a sweet schoolgirl."
The Exorcist,Chris Cobb,Ottawa Citizen,10.0,2023-9-29,"The tension is created by brilliant direction, tight editing, hydraulics, Linda Blair's makeup and the voice of the Prince of Darkness that chills the spine and showers the body with goosebumps. The acting in this dark movie is flawless, too."
The Exorcist,Bill Muller,Arizona Republic,10.0,2023-9-29,"It is carefully constructed, filled with nuance, designed to build fear one minute at a time. There can be no escape, no break, just the horror unfolding before your eyes."
The Exorcist,Christopher Borrelli,Toledo Blade,10.0,2023-9-29,The Exorcist is a masterful movie three decades later because it was made by filmmakers who had something to say and who knew when to use restraint and when to entertain and when to burrow under your skin.
Sleuth,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,8.75,2023-9-6,"This is a capably envisioned picture, one of the few worthy remakes based on a classic."
Sleuth,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,3.0,2020-11-27,"Even without comparisons to previous iterations, it's difficult to appreciate the ludicrous twist that Branagh has inserted into this remake's final act."
Sleuth,Walter Chaw,Film Freak Central,2.5,2009-8-14,"It requires a light touch; I admire Branagh a great deal, but not for his light touch."
Sleuth,Chris Laverty,Clothes on Film,4.0,2009-6-26,Idly plotted then tempered by a blunt ending. All of a sudden the viewer is left pondering 'eh?' as Pinter apparently run out of room on his pad.
Sleuth,Jim Lane,Sacramento News & Review,6.0,2008-8-7,
Sleuth,Alonso Duralde,MSNBC,4.0,2008-5-1,"Pinter's pauses, and the dour air of so much of the interplay, just don't fit on a story that's this slight."
Sleuth,David Stratton,At the Movies (Australia),5.0,2008-3-19,Fans of the original should stay away.
Sleuth,Peter Canavese,Groucho Reviews,7.5,2008-3-10,The script includes a verbal motif that reminds us of what binds the film's four central talents together: 'I want to show you something.' [Blu-Ray review]
Sleuth,David Cornelius,DVDTalk.com,6.0,2008-3-4,What this Sleuth lacks in enthusiasm it makes up in character-driven menace.
Sleuth,Ken Hanke,"Mountain Xpress (Asheville, NC)",8.0,2007-12-12,"What Pinter and Branagh present is a much more wicked, cold, disturbing film that is even more confined than the original."
Sleuth,Lawrence Toppman,Charlotte Observer,7.5,2007-12-7,"Seems to me that the Kenneth Branagh-Harold Pinter Sleuth is a pretty good movie. It just isn't a very good Sleuth, exactly."
Sleuth,Jennie Kermode,Eye for Film,7.0,2007-12-7,
Fiddler on the Roof,Wanda Hale,New York Daily News,10.0,2023-5-17,"Fiddler on the Roof, stunning, joyful, jubilant and emotion stirring, is an artistic triumph for Norman Jewison."
Fiddler on the Roof,Gene Siskel,Chicago Tribune,8.75,2023-5-16,"Yes, ""Fiddler"" on film is a full-blown, three-hour movie musical... But within the limitation of that most treacherous film form, director Norman Jewison has fashioned a sumptuous entertainment laden with happiness and tears... and taste."
Doctor Zhivago,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,10.0,2020-8-24,A masterpiece of emotional resonance and melodramatic romanticism.
Doctor Zhivago,Geoffrey Macnab,Independent (UK),8.0,2015-12-1,Maurice Jarre's music is as beguiling as ever and Lean squeezes all the pathos that he can out of the romance between Sharif's Yuri Zhivago and Julie Christie's febrile and gorgeous Lara Antipova.
Doctor Zhivago,David Parkinson,Radio Times,10.0,2015-11-27,This adaptation of Boris Pasternak's classic novel has all the sweep and stateliness that characterised David Lean's mastery of the epic.
Doctor Zhivago,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,10.0,2015-11-26,"Lean and Bolt pay tribute to a Tolstoyan ambition in Pasternak's samizdat novel, and also to a real contemporary relevance: the story of a suppressed writer."
Doctor Zhivago,David Jenkins,Little White Lies,4.0,2015-11-26,"Demands everything from the viewer while offering little in return, with Lean coming across like a despised schoolmaster not wanting to open himself up to his braying students."
Doctor Zhivago,Cath Clarke,Time Out,8.0,2015-11-24,Yes it's old-fashioned and sappy. But it's impossible not to swoon.
Doctor Zhivago,Emma Simmonds,The List,8.0,2015-11-23,"Whatever its flaws, films made with this much chutzpah last forever. Doctor Zhivago wears its daunting runtime like the lightest of shawls and, even after all these years, it's still worth surrendering your heart to."
Doctor Zhivago,Josh Larsen,LarsenOnFilm,7.5,2015-8-3,...an apocalypse movie in the guise of a romantic period piece.
Doctor Zhivago,S. Jhoanna Robledo,Common Sense Media,8.0,2010-12-30,"Epic drama combines romance, politics, mature themes."
Doctor Zhivago,Kevin Carr,7M Pictures,6.0,2010-5-13,it is to be respected for the massive success and artistry of the decade in which it was made
La dolce vita,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,10.0,2022-8-22,With “La Dolce Vita” Federico Fellini has created a masterpiece that feeds off of every aspect of the cinematic experience.
La dolce vita,Patrick McDonald,HollywoodChicago.com,10.0,2022-6-28,"Every frame of this film is like a black/white painting, in the sense that no matter how many years go by the images move within a pattern of interpretation. Human nature never changes, just the ways/means we can be seduced, while living LA DOLCE VITA!"
La dolce vita,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,10.0,2022-2-12,The second half is astonishing in its execution and emotional implications.
La dolce vita,Jordan M. Smith,IONCINEMA.com,9.0,2020-11-3,"It's an odd, but perfect encapsulation of Fellini's interest in the relationship between public figures, the media and consumers, now mutated creatures obsessed with the grotesque circus that is pop culture."
La dolce vita,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,6.0,2020-8-24,The aesthetic of a structureless arrangement of episodes overshadows commentary on vanishing morals and societal decay to the point that many viewers will miss the message.

Rio Bravo,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-24,"The glue of the film may be the supporting performances. There is no way “Rio Bravo” would be as good if not for Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, and Angie Dickinson."
Rio Bravo,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-2-14,"Few films have followed Western traditions with as much exhilarating craftsmanship, narrative and stylistic economy, or sheer escapist delight as Howard Hawks' Rio Bravo."
Rio Bravo,Josh Larsen,LarsenOnFilm,10.0,2017-3-5,Rio Bravo isn't a Fordian display of vast Western visas; the contours explored here are emotional.
Rio Bravo,Tony Sloman,Radio Times,10.0,2013-4-23,"Underrated at the time of its release, this majestically paced western is one of the finest achievements of the genre and stands as a career-best for many of its participants."
Rio Bravo,Christopher Null,Contactmusic.com,7.0,2013-4-23,"A definitive piece of Americana by way of Howard Hawks, Rio Bravo is what the late 1950s studio system was all about"
Rio Bravo,Roger Ebert,Chicago Sun-Times,10.0,2013-4-23,"To watch Rio Bravo is to see a master craftsman at work. The film is seamless. There is not a shot that is wrong. It is uncommonly absorbing, and the 141-minute running time flows past like running water."
Anatomy of a Murder,Alistair Lawrence,Common Sense Media,8.0,2023-2-15,"With no character shown to be faultless, the movie's real masterstroke is to expose the messiness of criminal trials and America's divides."

Anatomy of a Murder,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,10.0,2020-8-15,"It's a taut series of duels between quick-thinkers, each one distinctly deceptive, hilarious, calculating, and creative."
Anatomy of a Murder,Mattie Lucas,From the Front Row,8.75,2019-6-4,"[A] fierce, uncompromising exploration of the American legal system."
Anatomy of a Murder,Miles Fielder,The List,10.0,2019-4-24,Anatomy of a Murder remains an at times shocking indictment of Eisenhower-era America and an all-around terrific thriller.
Anatomy of a Murder,Adrian Turner,Radio Times,10.0,2013-11-6,This is probably the greatest courtroom drama ever made and it features James Stewart's finest screen performance.
Anatomy of a Murder,Matthew Sorrento,Film International,10.0,2012-6-8,"(Stewart's character) finishes the film an enigma, possibly the good go-getter of Capra but too much of a shadow."
Anatomy of a Murder,Matt Brunson,Creative Loafing,10.0,2012-4-25,"Otto Preminger, no stranger to ruffling moral-watchdog feathers, never succumbs to the sleaziness inherent in the material, instead turning out an intelligent and tightly controlled drama that ranks as one of the all-time great courtroom procedurals."
Anatomy of a Murder,Eric Melin,Scene-Stealers.com,7.5,2012-3-9,"Even with the glut of crime-related TV dramas that pepper today's screens, you'd be hard pressed to find a courtroom story that doesn't have you rooting one way or the other with a heavy-handed POV. This one doesn't it's way ahead of its time."
Anatomy of a Murder,James Kendrick,Q Network Film Desk,8.75,2012-3-1,simultaneously plays by and punctures the expectations of the courtroom thriller
Anatomy of a Murder,Christopher Long,Movie Metropolis,8.0,2012-2-23,"As courtroom thrillers go, it has few peers."
Touch of Evil,Danielle Solzman,Solzy at the Movies,9.0,2022-11-14,The film noir genre's visual style has Touch of Evil to thank for its contributions in sound and cinematography as Orson Welles and Russell Metty are a match made in heaven.
Touch of Evil,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-27,“Touch of Evil” is a movie filled with craft and vision.
Touch of Evil,Fred Camper,Chicago Reader,10.0,2022-6-16,"But as masterful as Welles’s filming is, what makes Touch of Evil a staggering masterpiece is the global quality of his style..."
Touch of Evil,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,10.0,2022-4-9,"This dazzling achievement has the rare good fortune of being one of those films that somehow seems to improve with each subsequent viewing -- the highest compliment indeed, given that it only takes one showing to evaluate its substantial worth."
Touch of Evil,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-3-20,Touch of Evil remains a masterpiece in its repaired state.
Touch of Evil,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,5.0,2020-8-23,"The desperation and anxiety are extreme, mitigated by weak minds and aided by an inexplicable ally."
Touch of Evil,Xan Brooks,Independent (UK),10.0,2019-3-20,"Citizen Kane may be the more weighty, rounded work, but Touch of Evil is a heap more fun."
Touch of Evil,PJ Nabarro,Patrick Nabarro,8.0,2018-11-8,Welles manufactures another of his masterly treatises on the power of light and shade - Touch of Evil is as gothic and expressive as any Murnau picture.
Touch of Evil,David Jenkins,Little White Lies,10.0,2015-7-10,"Like the bomb that's lobbed in the boot of the soft-top car in its opening scene, Touch Of Evil is a film where we can hear the faint sound of ticking in our heads, but don't realise what the problem is before it's far too late."

Sweet Smell of Success,Roger Moore,Movie Nation,10.0,2023-7-26,"The look is as lurid as black and white cinematography ever got...The music is jazz at its sleaziest -- brassy, brazen, squawking in protest to be heard over the din of the dialogue. And those words pure poetry, straight from pens dipped in poison."
Sweet Smell of Success,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-25,"There is nothing redeeming and respectable about its cruel and shameless lead characters. But in terms of wickedly smart and thoroughly compelling filmmaking, “Sweet Smell” is top of the line."
Sweet Smell of Success,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-3-18,"Sweet Smell of Success replaces shootouts with verbal ricochets, affirming, both on and offscreen, that when the words are dagger-sharp, the pen remains mightier than the sword."
Sweet Smell of Success,Ernesto Diezmartinez,Cine Vértigo,7.5,2021-10-18,A movie that could have been made yesterday. The corruption that he portrays is still so rampant and perhaps it is worse because now these types of characters do not have the power they had.
Sweet Smell of Success,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,8.0,2020-8-23,"The subject matter is incredibly mature, despite being shrouded by 1957-appropriate insinuation rather than graphic depiction."
Sweet Smell of Success,Wendy Ide,Times (UK),10.0,2015-4-9,New York never looked as thrillingly sordid as it does in this scabrous masterpiece.
Sweet Smell of Success,Hank Sartin,Time Out,10.0,2011-11-17,
Sweet Smell of Success,Wesley Lovell,Cinema Sight,6.25,2011-8-15,A meandering drama about the lure of success and the ignominious aggression of defeat.
Sweet Smell of Success,Matthew Sorrento,Film Threat,10.0,2011-3-7,"It all begins with the title. The irony aside, its lightness and alliteration suggest the last breaths of one of the film's victims."
La Strada,Yasser Medina,Cinefilia,8.0,2023-12-13,"It carries with it, in a sublime and sad way, Fellini's neorealist spirit. [Full review in Spanish]"
La Strada,Janet Graves,Photoplay,10.0,2022-9-14,"Its two American stars, Anthony Quinn and Richard Basehart, are both excellent, but the picture belongs to a funny-faced, likable little Italian actress, Giulietta Masina."
Stalag 17,James Kendrick,Q Network Film Desk,8.75,2024-3-27,"both a mordant comedy and a stark drama, a character study and an invigorating thriller"
Stalag 17,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,7.5,2023-11-25,The drama survives intact but the humor proves to be a serious drag.
Stalag 17,Wanda Hale,New York Daily News,10.0,2022-11-5,Wilder has turned the original into a highly satisfactory film which we can all cheer for general excellence.

Roman Holiday,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,10.0,2020-9-19,"An utterly disarming romantic comedy. The ""Mouth of Truth"" scene is a genuine classic, but the film is packed with equally delightful interludes."
Roman Holiday,Allison Rose,FlickDirect,10.0,2020-9-15,The marrying of a classic movie with the most up to date technology makes this release a must-have.
Roman Holiday,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,5.0,2020-8-23,"None of the events are terribly thrilling or romantic, and the unhurried casualness with which they're all approached borders on boring."

Roman Holiday,Tony Sloman,Radio Times,10.0,2014-2-10,"Immaculately directed by William Wyler, and written and played with style and grace, this is a film to treasure, both for its endearing action and marvellous performances."
Roman Holiday,Allan Hunter,Daily Express (UK),10.0,2013-7-19,As welcome as a cooling gelato on a hot summer's day.
Roman Holiday,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,10.0,2013-7-18,A lovely film.
Roman Holiday,David Jenkins,Little White Lies,6.0,2013-7-18,"Hepburn represents all western cinema, finally allowed out to play on the cobbled streets of postwar Europe."
A Streetcar Named Desire,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-19,"It’s rough, depressing, and unstarched, but it's so potent because of the characters. They are overflowing with energy and life and it is impossible not to be mesmerized by them despite their dysfunction."
A Streetcar Named Desire,Matt Neal,ABC Radio (Australia),10.0,2021-10-26,"The emotions are dialled up to 11 by the sweltering New Orleans heat and Marlon Brando's physique, which is matched by his titanic performance."
A Streetcar Named Desire,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,6.0,2020-8-23,"By the end of this Elia Kazan production, the revelations aren't shocking or memorable or morbidly palatable; in many ways, they're just depressing."
A Streetcar Named Desire,Ed Potton,Times (UK),8.0,2020-2-10,Elia Kazan's claustrophobic close-ups do a fine job of recreating the intensity of the stage.
A Streetcar Named Desire,Alasdair Bayman,CineVue,8.0,2020-2-6,"Even taking this performance alone, Brando's work deserves to be known as an abiding cinematic performance. Amongst cowardly and callous acts, there still rests a level of pathos to the character."
A Streetcar Named Desire,Brandon Judell,Bay Area Reporter,9.0,2019-1-9,"Also screened was A Streetcar Named Desire, revamped with the four additional minutes that were excised years ago by censors. It was being paraded about as if a half-hour had been added. So now Stella walks down the steps sultrily."
A Streetcar Named Desire,Pablo Villaça,Cinema em Cena,10.0,2016-11-7,The fact it was the fifth most lucrative film in its year of release is a depressing sign of how we have infantilized ourselves as spectators. [Full review in Portuguese.]
A Streetcar Named Desire,David Keyes,Cinemaphile.org,10.0,2014-11-29,Seeing the film reminds us instantly of our perennial desire to be swept up into a compelling story.

In a Lonely Place,Ray Pride,Newcity,10.0,2022-10-30,"As in the finest exemplars of film noir, the screenplay is a fated funhouse of crisscrossing intentions: not only does Ray burrow into the subtext with his own romantic struggles, he describes how to make movies like the one we’re watching."
In a Lonely Place,Roger Moore,Movie Nation,8.75,2022-5-6,A classic noir that stands among Bogart’s best.
In a Lonely Place,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,10.0,2020-10-13,"A beautiful yet devastating piece of cinema that operates as a bleak film noir, a compelling murder-mystery, a scathing critique of Hollywood, and a character study of penetrating depth."
In a Lonely Place,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,9.0,2020-8-23,"What matters isn't whether or not he's innocent, but that he could have committed the crime just the same."
In a Lonely Place,Piers Marchant,Arkansas Democrat-Gazette,7.5,2020-8-11,"Bogart, always brilliant at playing bitter, adds a frightening aspect of fury to Dix, casting his impulses as well beyond his control -- he manages to make cutting a grapefruit seem like an act of vengeance."
In a Lonely Place,Michael J. Casey,Boulder Weekly,8.0,2020-7-14,One of the most acidic looks at Hollywood - and one of the best.
In a Lonely Place,Dudley Early,Austin American-Statesman,5.0,2020-6-19,"Bogey has got himself a pretty good picture here, the best he has had of the last several."

In a Lonely Place,Simon Kinnear,Total Film,10.0,2017-11-24,A volatile Bogart drops the charm to deliver perhaps his finest performance.
In a Lonely Place,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,10.0,2017-11-22,Humphrey Bogart's world-weariness and romanticism take on something brutal and misogynist in this 1950 noir masterpiece directed by Nicholas Ray - and it's a marvellous performance by Gloria Grahame.
In a Lonely Place,Walter Chaw,Film Freak Central,10.0,2016-7-11,"It's a deeply Freudian film that happens to understand Freud--testament to its enduring, unshakable nature."
In a Lonely Place,James Kendrick,Q Network Film Desk,10.0,2016-6-8,"achieves an absolutely unrelenting grip because Ray plays so expertly on our associations, turning them inside out and against us"
Kind Hearts and Coronets,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,9.0,2020-8-13,"The narration is splendidly wry and full of details, revealing dastardly intentions and acerbic observations."
Kind Hearts and Coronets,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,8.75,2019-9-14,A diabolically clever comedy.
Kind Hearts and Coronets,Mattie Lucas,From the Front Row,8.75,2019-9-13,"As scathing a critique of the British upper classes as the cinema has ever given us, disguised as a light comedy with a charming exterior."
Kind Hearts and Coronets,Brian Viner,Daily Mail (UK),10.0,2019-6-7,"Even the title, from a poem by Tennyson, is perfect. A bona fide treat."
Kind Hearts and Coronets,Keir Roper-Caldbeck,The Skinny,8.0,2011-9-1,Shot through with pitch black humour and biting satire on both the moribund upper class and the grasping venality of the suburban middle class.
Kind Hearts and Coronets,Derek Malcolm,London Evening Standard,10.0,2011-8-19,Amazingly courageous for its day (1949) in combining bad taste with good comedy.
Kind Hearts and Coronets,Bob McCabe,Empire Magazine,10.0,2011-8-19,Kind Hearts gently undermines the notions of nobility and inherited privilege.

Kind Hearts and Coronets,Paul M. Bradshaw,Little White Lies,10.0,2011-8-18,"Technically brilliant and savagely funny, serial killing has never looked so much fun."
Rope,Wesley Lovell,Cinema Sight,7.5,2023-10-4,"The film’s biggest strength is in its tantalizing plot. “Rope” is a very good movie that suffers only from its somewhat false sense of editing, but overall benefits from Hitchcock’s masterful direction."
Rope,Trace Thurman,Horror Queers Podcast,7.0,2021-8-16,"An entertaining exercise in technical prowess, if not exactly suspense. The queer undertones alone make it worth a watch, though."
Rope,Michael J. Casey,Boulder Weekly,7.0,2020-7-30,"Hitchcock manages to keep everything light and humorous, but not without taking a couple of shots at a callous society actively choosing not to hear what they don't like."
Rope,TV Guide Staff,TV Guide,6.0,2019-2-9,"Although the story of this verbose film is intriguing, it's not top-drawer Hitchcock."
Rope,Robin Karney,Radio Times,6.0,2019-2-9,A disappointing addition to the great director's canon of work.
Rope,David Parkinson,Empire Magazine,8.0,2019-2-9,"The trickery is still distracting, but there are hints in this 1948 film of the perversity that will yield Psycho, Strangers On A Train, Vertigo and Rear Window, so it's a must for Hitch collectors."
Rope,Tim Brayton,Antagony & Ecstasy,7.0,2016-12-4,"While its fearless attempt to do something new makes it one of Hitchcock's most interesting movies, I can't pretend to regard it as anywhere near his best."
Rope,David Keyes,Cinemaphile.org,10.0,2014-2-11,Rope isn't merely a terrific movie; it is also a benchmark for which the intricate nature of the killer's mind can be simplified into immense clarity.
Out of the Past,Taylor Baker,Drink in the Movies,7.5,2021-8-28,Episode 6: Bourbon and Smoke
Out of the Past,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,10.0,2020-8-14,"An archetypal film noir featuring bright white lights, extra dark shadows, heavy rain, perpetually lit cigarettes, and a generous portion of flashback storytelling."
Out of the Past,Tom Meek,Cambridge Day,8.75,2020-4-6,"[Jacques] Tourneur's pacing and tempo is flawless, and [Robert] Mitchum in a trench coat and full of taciturn machismo is on par with Bogie, who owned the trademark."

Out of the Past,Keith Phipps,The Dissolve,10.0,2014-9-17,"Out Of The Past is undeniably a film noir, and rightly regarded as one of the genre's best."
Out of the Past,John Beifuss,"Commercial Appeal (Memphis, TN)",10.0,2014-9-4,"'Maybe we thought the world would end,' Mitchum muses, during a short-lived spell of happiness in Mexico. 'Maybe we thought it was a dream.' A dream? In his trench coat and fedora, he's clearly not a man destined to die quietly in his bed."
Out of the Past,Wesley Lovell,Cinema Sight,8.75,2011-8-16,Few films noir were better than this.
Out of the Past,Gabe Leibowitz,Film and Felt,8.8,2010-5-2,"Out of the Past should be considered a prototypical example of how to do noir the right way--shadowy corners, double crossings aplenty, a luscious femme fatale, and, of course, murders."
Brief Encounter,Phil Hall,Film Threat,9.0,2008-11-7,A genuinely touching made-for-TV film that has been unfairly maligned by critics.
Arsenic and Old Lace,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,10.0,2022-10-18,It's not mere hyperbole to state that Frank Capra's Arsenic and Old Lace ranks as one of the funniest films ever made.

Arsenic and Old Lace,Emanuel Levy,EmanuelLevy.Com,6.0,2005-7-17,"Unable to conceal the film's theatrical origins, Capra misfires as a director and misguides Cary Garnt, who's too mannered, but the time, the combo of horror and comedy was new and the old ladies' gruseome hobby was shocking to audiences."
The Maltese Falcon,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,10.0,2023-4-8,"“The stuff that dreams are made of,” comments Spade about the elusive black bird of the title, a sentiment easily applied to this indisputable masterpiece."
The Maltese Falcon,Allison Rose,FlickDirect,10.0,2023-4-4,Many people feel The Maltese Falcon is when Bogart became “Bogie”.  He exuded a certain calm and cool demeanor that made guys want to grab a beer with him and made women want to date him.

All Quiet on the Western Front,Eve O'Dea,Next Best Picture,9.0,2022-10-27,"The film also deserves high praise for its dynamic camera work, editing, production design, and other technical aspects that contribute to its authenticity and relatability almost one hundred years later."
All Quiet on the Western Front,Don Shanahan,Every Movie Has a Lesson,10.0,2022-6-26,It enormously earns its reverence and celebrated place among war films and epics. Make no mistake. This film's resonance has not diminished with time or changing movie tastes.

Bronenosets Potemkin,Kenneth Turan,Los Angeles Times,10.0,2011-3-17,It is a knockout.
Bronenosets Potemkin,Joshua Rothkopf,Time Out,10.0,2011-1-12,"For a piece of propaganda, this has a lot more artfulness than you'll recall, replete with quiet moments of public mourning and a stirring flag-hoisting (dyed red on the new print, too)."
Bronenosets Potemkin,Jesse Cataldo,Slant Magazine,10.0,2011-1-10,Sergei Eisenstein's masterpiece is a persistently political work salvaged by its unforgettable grasp of motion.
Knives Out,Denise Pieniazek,Puesta en Escena (AR),8.0,2024-1-27,"In Knives Out, the crime is treated through the police enigma genre that will keep the viewer entertained from beginning to end, through the excellent dosage of information and the different twists and turns that its resolution presents."
Knives Out,Serena Seghedoni,Loud and Clear Reviews,9.0,2023-8-13,"Witty, unpredictable and surprisingly insightful, Rian Johnson’s whodunnit Knives Out keeps you guessing until the very end."
Knives Out,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,8.0,2022-8-22,"Not only is Johnson enjoying himself, but the entire cast is clearly having a blast. And how could they not? Johnson creates for them a narrative playground full of whip-smart dialogue, genre nostalgia, and with a biting sense of humor."
Knives Out,Victor Pineyro,Seventh Art Studio,7.0,2022-7-7,It has good performances and brushes of originality and freshness. Yet it tries so hard for the audience's approval and validation it becomes somewhat bugging. Good movie nonetheless. [Full review in Spanish]

Knives Out,Olly Richards,NME (New Musical Express),8.0,2021-4-29,"A thrilling, expertly-crafted whodunit..."
Knives Out,Tori Brazier,Flickering Myth,9.0,2021-3-25,"Knives Out is a self-aware, stylised farce that has a great time - and pulls you along with it."
Dil Bechara,Hannah Rachel Abraham,Cultured Vultures,6.5,2020-8-12,"Sushant's final on-screen appearance shines because of him and not much else. On the whole, an average watch and certainly not comparable to the original."
Dil Bechara,Aarti Jhurani,The National (UAE),9.0,2020-8-7,"This short (at least by Bollywood standards at 100 minutes) and sweet story is worth a watch for the myriad characters, including an appearance by Saif Ali Khan."
Dil Bechara,Stutee Ghosh,The Quint,5.0,2020-7-31,it's tough to not tear up. His natural warmth is a crucial element of the film's emotional design. Sushant and Sanjana's tenderness carries the film as does the performance of the ensemble cast .
Dil Bechara,Saibal Chatterjee,NDTV,6.0,2020-7-27,"The film will obviously always belong to Sushant Singh Rajput - on the money all the way, his performance demonstrates exactly why the chops he possessed weren't ordinary."
Dil Bechara,Anna M.M. Vetticad,Firstpost,4.0,2020-7-27,"Dil Bechara subtracts from the positives of the original with its slipshod rewriting, sloppy editing, and ordinary production quality."
Dil Bechara,Shubhra Gupta,The Indian Express,5.0,2020-7-27,It is the occasional sweetness that Sushant Singh Rajput and Sanjana Sanghi Sanghi manage to rustle up that carries the film.
Dil Bechara,Devesh Sharma,Filmfare,7.0,2020-7-27,"Sanjana Sanghi has made a delightful debut as the girl who finds love when she least expects it. She discovers life in the process and comes to realise that joy, even in small quantities, is something worth cherishing."

Call Me by Your Name,Ben Turner,The Pink Lens,10.0,2021-9-2,"While it's the simmering sexual tension that keeps you watching for most of the film, it's only later that you realise this is a character piece about a man's bluster and how his confidence does not make him strong."

Hunt for the Wilderpeople,Joe Lipsett,Hazel & Katniss & Harry & Starr Podcast,8.0,2024-3-26,"Waititi's long-in-development adaptation of the Crump's classic has a style and wit all of its own. Neill is delightfully grumpy, but it is Dennison who steals the show. The over the top buffoonery of the final chase is a bit much, though"
Hunt for the Wilderpeople,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-21,This fun little odyssey pulls from so many directions but always maintains its balance. It’s genuinely tender and sweet but never overly sentimental.
Hunt for the Wilderpeople,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-4-11,"Achieves a pitch-perfect balance of silly humor and compassionate characters, proving both oddly funny and profoundly moving despite some very clichéd archetypes propelling the story."
Hunt for the Wilderpeople,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,7.5,2021-8-18,Hunt for the Wilderpeople is excellent when it focuses solely on the relationship between - and the misadventures of - its two central figures. It's less captivating when the attention turns to several doltish supporting characters.
Hunt for the Wilderpeople,Olly Richards,NME (New Musical Express),10.0,2021-4-22,"A little bit Rambo, a little bit The Goonies, and as good a time as you can ever hope to have in the cinema."
Hunt for the Wilderpeople,Heidy Morales,Hye's Musings,8.0,2021-2-21,"Bombastic chases, dark humour, and poignantly truthful moments make Hunt For The Wilderpeople more meaningful than many other big name action or comedies out there. Definitely a film that everyone should see."
Hunt for the Wilderpeople,Roger Moore,Movie Nation,7.5,2020-12-23,"What sticks with you...is the sweetness, the soft edges Neill gives to his bush-savvy curmudgeon, the kid's street ""smarts"" that're really just naivete."
Hunt for the Wilderpeople,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,7.0,2020-12-5,"It's mostly effective and funny, though not every moment works entirely."
Hunt for the Wilderpeople,Yasser Medina,Cinefilia,8.0,2020-6-27,"Waititi proves it by maintaining a cartoonish tone that very well balances drama, comedy, and a sentimentality well worth getting excited for. [Full review in Spanish]"
Hunt for the Wilderpeople,Kate Rodger,Newshub (NZ),10.0,2019-9-7,"There is a beating heart amidst the crackling one-liners, which once again elevates Waititi's storytelling from the merely entertaining to the instant classic."
Hunt for the Wilderpeople,Karl Delossantos,Smash Cut Reviews,9.0,2019-8-6,"It has everything you want in a film - memorable characters, an interesting story, and, most importantly, heart."
Captain Fantastic,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-19,Matt Ross’s story of this off-the-grid family clashing with the outside world naturally has its funny moments. But it’s also a film filled with genuine feeling.

Captain Fantastic,Mae Abdulbaki,Movies with Mae,8.0,2019-4-5,"""Captain Fantastic"" is all heart and is strengthened by Mortensen's performance. It's a new take on the idea of family, but one that is a fresh look on a different version of it."
Captain Fantastic,Nick Evan-Cook,One Room With A View,8.0,2019-4-3,A triumph of pure sincerity and heartfelt good vibes.
Sing Street,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,8.0,2022-8-25,"The real surprises may be Carney’s collection of acting unknowns who make up the band. Their camaraderie is infectious, and watching them create music and find fulfillment gets to the true heart of “Sing Street”."
Sing Street,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,7.5,2022-4-15,"It's quite underwhelming when a film about making music features original songs that everyone in the story goes gonzo over, but then the songs aren't that memorable. Sing Street doesn't have that problem in the slightest."
Sing Street,David Gonzalez,The Cinematic Reel,10.0,2022-2-14,"Within the many themes of the film. Sing Street is a testament to the true importance of music. The simplicity that through any bad situation, music is always at your disposal and will always understand what you are going through, when no one else does."
Sing Street,Richard Crouse,Richard Crouse,8.0,2021-2-3,Celebrates risk taking and underdogs in a story that is as joyful as it is tuneful.

Sing Street,Yasser Medina,Cinefilia,8.0,2020-6-26,We are facing a delicious comedy that uses music as the heartbeat of a heart in love to seduce us with its apparent melodious romanticism. [Full review in Spanish]
Sing Street,Kate Rodger,Newshub (NZ),8.0,2019-8-29,Sing Street should be watched at full volume and with an open heart.
Sing Street,Karl Delossantos,Smash Cut Reviews,8.0,2019-8-7,"Yes, the drama can feel a bit contrived. But it's delivered and packaged in such an entertaining way with memorable characters. It easily lands amongst the best films of the year for me."
Sing Street,Bertie Archer,One Room With A View,8.0,2019-4-2,Sing Street is a touching and toe-tapping delight from start to finish.
Nightcrawler,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,8.0,2022-8-24,"It’s such a creepy, tense, and efficient crime/psychological thriller."
Nightcrawler,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-7-18,"Beneath Nightcrawler’s outward critique of the media’s desperate need to see and record human atrocity for mass ratings, there’s a more disturbing character study about Gyllenhaal’s fascinating and fantastically played psychopath."
Nightcrawler,Danilo Castro,Next Best Picture,8.0,2022-5-17,Nightcrawler is simply one of the best crime films of the 2010s.
Nightcrawler,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,7.5,2022-4-10,"In a knockout performance, Jake Gyllenhaal plays Louis Bloom, the type of guy who would not only sell his own mother but would chop her up into tiny pieces to facilitate the transaction."
Nightcrawler,Dan Brightmore,NME (New Musical Express),10.0,2021-5-26,Jake Gyllenhaal's transformation deserves an Oscar in one of this year's best films...
Nightcrawler,Richard Crouse,Richard Crouse,8.0,2021-2-2,"Paints an ugly picture of the news business, but it's not simply a satire or condemnation. It's frequently funny and there are some very tense action scenes, but at the end it is Gyllenhaal's bold performance that stands out."
Nightcrawler,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,9.0,2020-12-4,"Thanks to Gyllenhaal's quirky and unhinged performance, this is a volatile ride worth taking."
Nightcrawler,Stephen A. Russell,The New Daily (Australia),10.0,2020-8-26,Dan Gilroy's pitch black satire of the 24/7 news cycle and our morbid fascination with the misery of others is a devious delight.
Nightcrawler,Prahlad Srihari,Firstpost,9.0,2020-7-24,Bloom's vulture-like instincts and sense of ambition is symptomatic of a society that enjoys its breakfast cereal with a spoon of blood-tinged violence.
Nightcrawler,Kelechi Ehenulo,Confessions From A Geek Mind,8.0,2020-7-16,It skilfully juggles a character with no redeeming features through his obsession with his work and thrusts him into a world where the lines between right and wrong are always questioned and debated.
Nightcrawler,PJ Nabarro,Patrick Nabarro,6.0,2020-6-27,Gyllenhaal is compelling and there is some truth in the way his character is able to elevate his status through sheer dogged determination and the demented zeal of a sociopath
Jojo Rabbit,Serena Seghedoni,Loud and Clear Reviews,10.0,2023-10-30,"Taika Waititi's Nazi comedy Jojo Rabbit is delightfully absurd and surprisingly poetic, and unlike anything you've ever seen before."
Jojo Rabbit,Dallas King,Flick Feast,4.0,2022-11-11,Much of the comedy is too broad to truly satirise the subject matter... unable to nail the emotional beats when it finally confronts the true reality and horror of the situation.
Jojo Rabbit,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-22,"The film’s ability to make you laugh, cry, or be utterly appalled is one of its many strengths."
Jojo Rabbit,Victor Pineyro,Seventh Art Studio,9.0,2022-7-7,This was the movie that made me laugh and cry the most in 2019. It created this absolutely perfect mixture between satire and drama. Every joke hits all the good spots. Waititi's best work? Probably. [Full review in Spanish]
Jojo Rabbit,Dan Bayer,Next Best Picture,8.0,2022-5-13,"War is absurd. Art has been making this point for centuries now, but few pieces of art have fully embraced that absurdity as much as Taika Waititi’s Jojo Rabbit."
Jojo Rabbit,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-2-23,"Waititi's message of anti-hate proves resounding and good-natured, leaving the audience firmly dismissive toward the film's target: the hatred inherent to Nazi ideology."
Jojo Rabbit,Taylor Baker,Drink in the Movies,8.0,2021-12-1,Episode 52: Jojo Rabbit / The Lighthouse / Parasite

Jojo Rabbit,Jesus Agudo,eCartelera,7.0,2020-10-16,"Jojo Rabbit knows when it has to get emotional, and that is way better than its comedy. [Full review in Spanish]"

The Artist,Danilo Castro,Next Best Picture,7.0,2023-8-31,"It isn’t easy to get modern audiences to engage with a film that looks like it was made a century prior. Yet, that’s precisely what director Michel Hazanavicius manages to do."

Edge of Tomorrow,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,8.75,2023-2-15,Endlessly entertaining and ceaselessly innovative
Edge of Tomorrow,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-20,"There’s some good science fiction, strategic funny moments, exhilarating action, and a smart and sharp story that never grows dull."
Edge of Tomorrow,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,8.75,2022-8-15,"Regardless of the various other films that Edge of Tomorrow could be compared to, the end result feels strangely unique, and not for a moment during its two-hour runtime does it lose the audience to thoughts of its influences."
Edge of Tomorrow,Don Shanahan,Every Movie Has a Lesson,8.0,2022-8-14,"There's a certain unexpected humor coming out of ""Edge of Tomorrow"" that boosts its doom-and-gloom alien invasion setup."
Edge of Tomorrow,Danielle Solzman,Solzy at the Movies,8.0,2022-7-5,Edge of Tomorrow: Live. Die. Repeat manages to keep audiences on the edge of their seats in this WWII-esque sci-fi action thriller.

Edge of Tomorrow,Richard Crouse,Richard Crouse,8.0,2021-2-1,The first two reels are packed with energy and invention it's only when the conventions that made the story enticing are put aside in the last reel that the movie becomes a standard Cruise action flick.
Edge of Tomorrow,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,7.0,2020-12-4,"Unexpectedly clever surprises keep the anticipation and mystification rolling, while the action sequences are plentiful and intense."
Edge of Tomorrow,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,7.5,2020-9-7,"Edge of Tomorrow is proof, once again, that Cruise can certainly be knocked down but can never be counted as completely out."
Edge of Tomorrow,Stephen A. Russell,The New Daily (Australia),9.0,2020-8-26,"Liman deftly orchestrates the destruction, ensuring it doesn't sink into mind-numbing Transformers fare. Blunt and Cruise invest a great deal of heart in their action heroics, thankfully minimising the hokum romance angle."
The Irishman,KT Mahe,For Your Reference Podcast,6.0,2024-2-20,"The Irishman has the same Scorsese beats we have come to love but moves to a noticeably staggered rhythm in it's device of storytelling, laboured performances and reluctance to commit to the brutal energy of Goodfellas."
The Irishman,Oti,For Your Reference Podcast,6.0,2024-2-20,"The Irishman tests patience with its runtime and less effective storytelling on a second watch. CGI de-aging distracts, yet Scorsese's touch shines in cinematography."
The Irishman,Denise Pieniazek,Puesta en Escena (AR),10.0,2024-1-27,"One of the most important characteristics of the gangster genre is that we access the story through the point of view of the protagonist, in this case Frank Sheeran, who, is an immigrant.

The Irishman,M.N. Miller,Ready Steady Cut,9.0,2022-8-22,"The Irishman is Scorsese’s Gangster Epic: A big, grand, ambitious rags to riches mob tale that blurs the lines between loyalty, friendship, and business. It might be the quickest 209-minutes in the history of cinema. Joe Pesci, welcome back."
The Irishman,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-22,You could say “The Irishman” is above all things a tragedy. Underneath its veneer of wise guy tradition and violence lies the story of a man facing the music for his embrace of mob life and neglect of his family.
The Irishman,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-2-23,"The best comparison one could make to The Irishman is David Lean's similarly epic-sized Lawrence of Arabia (1962), a biography that examines its subject for four hours before conceding to its unknowability."

Moon,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2023-9-4,"Rockwell gives a matchless performance that demonstrates anger, depression, humor, sadness, frustration, desperation, and even mild insanity. Being in almost every frame, he captures the audience completely"
Moon,Victoria Luxford,BBC.com,10.0,2022-6-24,"Made with only a fraction of your average Star Wars or Marvel movie, but does so much with (relatively little). Sam Rockwell is just fantastic given that he’s largely in the film on his own. A tremendous sci-fi movie."
Moon,PJ Nabarro,Patrick Nabarro,8.0,2021-11-5,"It falls very much in the lineage of earlier sci-fi classics, but still provides enough virtuosity and individuality to make it somewhat novel."
Moon,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,8.75,2021-8-31,"With Ziggy Stardust for a father, Major Tom for an uncle, and, presumably, the spiders from Mars for assorted in-laws, is it any wonder that Duncan Jones chose a science fiction project to mark his feature film debut?"
Moon,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,6.0,2020-11-29,"The film engagingly sets a cold, scarily inhumane atmosphere that is interesting but not spectacular."
Moon,Nikki Baughan,Roll Credits,8.0,2019-10-30,[A] beautifully-crafted fable about the consequences of human greed and unfettered technological endeavour that's plausible enough to be genuinely chilling.
Moon,David Harris,Spectrum Culture,7.0,2019-10-9,Rockwell gives a great performance in what is more or less a one-man film.
Moon,Kelly Jane Torrance,Washington Times,8.75,2018-12-6,"Suffice it to say, Mr. Rockwell more than carries the film, with a nuanced performance that speaks volumes about the fears of alienation and corruption that always seem to accompany our literature about the future."
Moon,David Keyes,Cinemaphile.org,10.0,2015-5-9,"A cue to the responsibility of filmmakers in a time when most seldom trust their audiences to think about answers, and asks questions that paralyze us in intricate fascination long after the final shot has left an imprint."
Moon,Dan Jardine,Cinemania,8.2,2013-6-5,Solaris and Blade Runner meet Silent Running. A movie with both a brain and a heart.
Moon,Jay Antani,Cinema Writer,7.5,2012-11-8,"Intriguing, imaginative, and thematically ambitious, Moon gives ample proof that Jones is a serious talent, pushing his concepts into intellectually and spiritually challenging territory."
Moon,Ali Gray,TheShiznit.co.uk,10.0,2012-9-29,It's a film that won't fail to move or excite anyone who's ever cast their eye skywards and let themselves wonder.
Moon,Ben Kenigsberg,Time Out,8.0,2011-11-17,
Moon,Josh Larsen,LarsenOnFilm,8.75,2011-3-28,Sam Rockwell should have been nominated for Best Actor at least twice.
Moon,Perri Nemiroff,CinemaBlend,8.0,2010-8-14,"Simple and alien-free example of the sci-fi genre. Slow, but there are so many details deserving attention, the chance to take them all in one only enhances the experience."
District 9,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2023-9-4,"Blomkamp doesn’t miss a step. His film is cynical, funny, smart, exciting, and satirical—all without losing his audience’s involvement in the scenario."
District 9,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,8.0,2020-11-28,One of the most creative and exciting science-fiction adventures in the last decade.
District 9,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,8.75,2020-9-6,FEELS oppressed and this oppression permeates virtually every single minute of the film's 112-minute runtime.
District 9,Nikki Baughan,Roll Credits,10.0,2019-10-29,"It's a genuinely impressive debut feature and unlike the singular experience of Cloverfield's faux-reality, District 9 has narrative, plus thematic weight and visceral thrills, which elevate it above the gimmick of the reality format."
District 9,Sarah Cartland,Caution Spoilers,8.0,2018-12-17,"Part found footage (or just footage), part mockumentary, part satire and part action; Blomkamp pulls it into a coherent, moving, violent, sci fi allegory. Copley is terrific as Wikus moving from species-ist opportunist to a genuine if gormless redemption."
District 9,Debbie Baldwin,Ladue News,7.0,2018-11-14,"I won't tell you to rush out and see it, but in these days of sequels and remakes, this was an interesting original."
District 9,Giovanni Fazio,Japan Times,6.0,2016-6-14,"It has become almost impossible to make a sci-fi film these days that doesn't spend its last 30 minutes in a multiple-orgasm roar of screaming, shooting and shattering explosions."
The Wrestler,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,7.5,2023-9-5,The Wrestler presents one of those rare occasions where the performance of its lead actor outweighs a film’s conventional story.
The Wrestler,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,7.0,2020-11-28,A grittily stark and oftentimes sadly humorous look into the life of a lamentable man and his tragic profession.
The Wrestler,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,10.0,2020-9-27,"It is powerful, yet it is graceful."
The Wrestler,Nikki Baughan,Roll Credits,10.0,2019-11-4,"But this is, of course, [Mickey] Rourke's moment. As the increasingly desperate and bewildered Ram he is aggressive and vulnerable, frightening and sympathetic as he struggles to find a place in a world that's leaving him behind."
The Wrestler,Mattie Lucas,"The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)",8.75,2019-6-6,Rourke has risen again and delivered a performance for the ages.
The Wrestler,Sarah Boslaugh,PopMatters,7.0,2018-11-3,...the real-life horror of professional wrestling is evident in the ruined bodies of Randy and his peers...
The Wrestler,Simon Miraudo,Quickflix,10.0,2014-10-21,"As the film points out, wrestling may be fixed, but it certainly ain't fake. This may be a film, but it certainly ain't fake either."
The Wrestler,Ali Gray,TheShiznit.co.uk,10.0,2012-9-29,"Emotional and engaging, The Wrestler is a masterful piece of work that deserves every award the Academy can throw at it."
Jab We Met,Jimmy Cage,Jimmy Cage Movie Reviews (YouTube),6.0,2022-3-27,JAB WE MET is a really nice and lovely boy meets girl movie that exudes enough charm to overlook the superficiality of the story and characters.
Jab We Met,Namrata Joshi,Outlook,7.5,2019-1-25,"It's these ironies of relationships, the warmth of characters and earthy humour that give a fresh twist to the age-old tale."
Boyhood,Don Shanahan,Every Movie Has a Lesson,10.0,2024-2-16,What makes Boyhood this extraordinary experience and achievement is the opposite of that adjective: the ordinary.  Linklater and company sought to deliver a genuine interpretation of a life experience without flashy movie bells and whistles.
Boyhood,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-19,"The film had me looking back on my own childhood, but also thinking about my 13-year old son and the life he is living. Walking out of the theater I wanted to hurry home, give him a hug, and tell him that I loved him."
Boyhood,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-8-5,"Inside this beautiful, simple, and ambitious film is an almost documentary quality to truth that, despite the film's lack of traditional plotting, engages the viewer in an indescribable way."
Boyhood,Danilo Castro,Next Best Picture,9.0,2022-5-17,"Linklater did the unthinkable, which is to capture our collective youth on film so that we may be able to relive it over and over again."
Boyhood,Gautam Anand,The Cinemaholic,10.0,2022-3-25,"The best feature of Boyhood is that it derives beauty, joy, and emotion out of the ordinary lives of people."
Boyhood,James Croot,Stuff.co.nz,10.0,2022-1-6,The magnum opus of one of the most creative directors of the past three decades is also perhaps the ultimate coming-of-age story.
Boyhood,Yasmin Omar,Harper's Bazaar,10.0,2021-6-25,"Boyhood exudes a verisimilitude seldom seen in cinema, an open-ended, fly-on-the-wall naturalness that appears unscripted."
Boyhood,Richard Crouse,Richard Crouse,9.0,2021-2-1,"A remarkable film but not a perfect one. At almost three hours it occasionally feels aimless, but as a chronicle of life it's an ambitious undertaking, a moving experience about the individual moments that make a life."
Boyhood,Leo Brady,AMovieGuy.com,8.75,2021-1-31,Boyhood is a moment of cinema that cannot be duplicated.
Boyhood,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,6.0,2020-12-4,"By the end, it's basically just a documentary."
Boyhood,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,10.0,2020-9-4,It is most certainly a rarity when ambition is met by remarkable achievement.
Boyhood,Stephen A. Russell,The New Daily (Australia),10.0,2020-8-26,"The simplicity of story in Linklater's Boyhood, following the not-overly eventful life of six-year-old Mason till he leaves home for college as a teen, is an incredible cinematic achievement."
Star Trek,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2023-9-5,"The exceptional thing about Abrams’ reimagining of the series, beyond being at once smart and more engaging than most other blockbusters, is that his film renews the franchise without starting from scratch."
Star Trek,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,7.0,2022-8-25,There were times where this didn’t feel anything like a Star Trek movie.
Star Trek,Danielle Solzman,Solzy at the Movies,9.0,2022-4-10,"Abrams, Orci, Kurtzman, and company manage to live up to the legacy that was passed down to them and give us one of the best films in Star Trek history."
Star Trek,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,8.0,2020-11-29,"The plot itself is a mixture of complex alternate realities, supernovas, black holes, red matter, and science-fiction jargon, but the pacing is keen."
Star Trek,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,8.75,2020-9-24,"So, J.J., accept our apologies? We're sorry for doubting you."
Star Trek,Shaun Munro,Flickering Myth,8.0,2020-5-31,"Without a whiff of calculated cynicism, Star Trek '09 gives the series a much-needed adrenaline injection, while retaining the heart and pathos which has defined it since the beginning."
Star Trek,Nikki Baughan,Roll Credits,10.0,2019-10-31,Star Trek is that very rare beast; an eye-popping summer blockbuster with genuine heart and soul.
Star Trek,David Harris,Spectrum Culture,7.0,2019-10-9,Genuine escapist entertainment that breathes new life into a franchise long adrift in the final frontier.
Star Trek,Mattie Lucas,"The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)",8.75,2019-6-6,"With its soaring space battles, gorgeous cinematography, and a grand score by Michael Giacchino, Star Trek is in many ways the quintessential summer blockbuster."
Star Trek,Kaleem Aftab,The List,8.0,2018-11-4,"What Abrams has done with Star Trek is not simply take old characters and give them a new sheen; he has reinvented the whole dynamic of the USS Enterprise, pretty much all for the good."
In Bruges,Stephen Silver,Tilt Magazine,8.0,2023-3-19,Nowhere did director Martin McDonagh better manage dark comedy than in his debut film (15th anniversary)
In Bruges,Wesley Lovell,Cinema Sight,10.0,2022-12-6,"In Bruges is a darkly humorous film that should be seen not just for the way it subverts genre norms, but also for how it sculpts and redefines them into something better."
In Bruges,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-11-3,"The movie is about meaningful conversations, idleness, boredom, remorse, hard laughs, stark violence, and grotesque humor—I loved it."
In Bruges,Danilo Castro,Next Best Picture,9.0,2022-10-20,"It’s got dialogue that can cut glass, performances akin to tight-rope displays, and constantly shifting alliances that keep us guessing."
In Bruges,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,7.5,2022-10-1,"Yes, it's yet one more violent, hipper-than-thou crime flick in love with its own dialogue. Yet for once, I'm not complaining."
In Bruges,Allison Rose,FlickDirect,9.0,2022-9-26,"In Bruges is one of those “hidden gems” you don’t necessarily hear much about but, once you’ve seen it, you can’t forget it."
In Bruges,Danielle Solzman,Solzy at the Movies,8.0,2022-9-25,"With In Bruges, Martin McDonagh has managed to hit a home run in his feature-length debut as a filmmaker."

In Bruges,Leigh Paatsch,Herald Sun (Australia),8.0,2022-6-2,An extraordinary comedy-drama written and directed with rat cunning and savage economy.
In Bruges,Fico Cangiano,CineXpress Podcast,7.0,2022-1-11,"A wonderful film that has so much going on underneath all the intelligent dark humor and hitmen premise. Farrell, Gleeson and Fiennes are fantastic. [Full review in Spanish]"
In Bruges,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,9.0,2020-11-28,One of the very best pictures of the year.
In Bruges,Sezín Koehler,Black Girl Nerds,7.0,2020-7-27,'In Bruges' is a fantastic Boschian nightmare with profound themes to go along with its dark comedy.
In Bruges,Kelechi Ehenulo,VultureHound,8.0,2020-7-15,"For McDonagh to fashionably incorporate the brilliantly assembled cast with the beautiful city as an unexplored yet subverted adventure, cement In Bruges' cult-like status as an underrated gem of modern cinema."
The Man from Earth,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,7.0,2020-11-26,"As far as heady sci-fi projects go, this might be the least traditional of them all."
The Man from Earth,Mark R. Leeper,rec.arts.movies.reviews,9.0,2008-9-15,Very probably will be one of the best science fiction films of this decade. It really deserves to be seen.
The Man from Earth,David Cornelius,eFilmCritic.com,8.0,2007-11-21,It's that rare film that rewards inquisitiveness.
Letters from Iwo Jima,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,6.0,2020-11-21,"Infinitely more compelling than its predecessor, yet equally lengthy and ill-paced."
Letters from Iwo Jima,Mattie Lucas,"The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)",10.0,2019-6-6,"In coming to understand the point of view of the opposing side, Eastwood has crafted two masterful and distinct films who are still inexorably intertwined that speak to the simple humanity in all of us."
Letters from Iwo Jima,Nick Rogers,Midwest Film Journal,10.0,2010-9-19,"Modern-day echoes of being snookered into a bad war aren't lost on Clint Eastwood, and ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" delivers an overwhelmingly powerful eulogy for the death of righteousness in combat on either side of the line."
Letters from Iwo Jima,Chris Fujiwara,Boston Phoenix,8.75,2009-4-23,"Eastwood is a master of the extended look (this comes from the two directors he acknowledges as his own masters, Sergio Leone and Don Siegel), the look that stretches time and that is blinded by what it sees."
Letters from Iwo Jima,Tony Macklin,Fayetteville Free Weekly,8.0,2009-2-2,The most important film of 2006 was Clint Eastwood's Letters from Iwo Jima. In 20 years Letters from Iwo Jima will be a classic.
Letters from Iwo Jima,Fred Topel,Hollywood.com,6.0,2008-11-20,"War is hell, always has been, and movies will continue to confirm it for anyone who might doubt. In this case, though, Letters only shows that for all the different perspective the other side of a war could have, it's the same old movie clichés."
Letters from Iwo Jima,Brandon Fibbs,BrandonFibbs.com,8.0,2008-2-28,"Eastwood's direction is a thing of beauty, blending unblinking ferocity with fragile delicacy."
Letters from Iwo Jima,Joe Lozito,Big Picture Big Sound,10.0,2007-7-14,"Much as already been made about the pride and honor of the Japanese, but as a people they have rarely, if ever, been depicted as fully human characters in American war movies. It's amazing to think what Clint Eastwood has done here."
Letters from Iwo Jima,Mike McGranaghan,Aisle Seat,8.75,2007-5-23,"Eastwood has made a film that is thoughtful, poignant, touching, and philosophical. It stands as one of the best works in his long, illustrious career."

Life of Pi,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,7.0,2022-8-23,The animation involved in bringing Richard Parker to life is something you just have to see. I was blown away.
Life of Pi,Danilo Castro,Next Best Picture,8.0,2022-7-28,"ee's directorial instincts are sharp as ever. He can cultivate a believable relationship between Pi and Richard, relying primarily on subtle body language and, of course, the masterful visual effects."
Life of Pi,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,5.0,2020-12-2,Why must bitter reality always rear its ugly head in such parables?

Life of Pi,Mattie Lucas,"The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)",7.5,2019-6-8,"Lee imbues the film with remarkable grace, even when its imagery threatens to overwhelm it."
Life of Pi,Shubhra Gupta,The Indian Express,7.0,2019-3-22,"A boy, and a tiger, and a vast, endless ocean. Ang Lee makes a film out of material that seems almost unfilmable, and a lot of it is quite wondrous."
Life of Pi,Allen Adams,The Maine Edge,7.0,2019-2-21,"Life of Pi is beautifully rendered with some fine performances. Unfortunately, this novel deemed by many to be 'unfilmable' ultimately proves to at least partially earn that distinction."
Life of Pi,Daniel Green,CineVue,10.0,2019-2-6,Lee has successfully married some of this year's most sumptuous visuals with one of its most compelling and unashamedly spiritual stories.
Life of Pi,Debbie Baldwin,Ladue News,8.0,2018-11-1,"Any old actor will tell you to never share the stage with children or animals. Certainly, that is the case here, as the film is almost exclusively child and animal -- and wonderful."
Iron Man,Joseph Garcia,Dynamic Duel Podcast,9.0,2023-1-18,"An exceptionally well-made debut for Marvel Studios. Fun, engaging and bolstered by a tour-de-force lead turn by Robert Downey Jr."
Iron Man,David Hogan,hoganreviews.co.uk,10.0,2021-2-24,A fun two-hours thanks to a top cast lead by a charismatic Robert Downey Jr. Most of the effects still hold up and the action scenes are still exciting.
Iron Man,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,8.75,2020-9-12,"If you don't like Iron Man, then you should stop going to movies."
Iron Man,Kaitlyn Booth,Bleeding Cool,8.0,2019-5-15,"Iron Man might feature a mesmerizing performance by Robert Downey Jr. and kicked off the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but that doesn't entirely save it from a weak villain or falling apart by the third act."
Iron Man,Danielle Solzman,Solzy at the Movies,10.0,2019-4-17,Iron Man may just be one adventure but the film is a lot more than that because it has the main responsibility of launching an entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Iron Man,Colby Bryant,Colbybryant.com,8.25,2018-12-8,"Few of the films in the (MCU) are as accessible as this one, and while you may not love it in your top-ten films of all-time, you can't beat the good time this film brings."
Iron Man,Mike Scott,Times-Picayune,7.5,2015-6-15,"His well-honed acting chops aside, a big reason the casting of Downey as Stark works so darn well is that incorrigible streak, which he somehow always has been able to balance with an irrepressible likability and which he uses to full effect here."
Shaun of the Dead,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-8-25,"Carefully balances its dark comedy, three-dimensional characters, and genuine chills."
Shaun of the Dead,Danilo Castro,Next Best Picture,9.0,2022-5-17,"Every single aspect of the film feels earned, including its classic status."

Shaun of the Dead,Sebastian Zavala Kahn,Me gusta el cine,10.0,2020-4-7,"The important thing is that Wright and Pegg don't lose sight of their characters; we laugh with them, not at them. [Full review in Spanish]"
Shaun of the Dead,PJ Nabarro,Patrick Nabarro,8.0,2018-11-3,"Wright's style is pure, cartoon aesthetic: all quick cuts, sharp points of focus, the precise merging of sound with a cut or pan and the crowd-pleasing use of pop tunes."
Mystic River,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,7.5,2019-3-3,Clint Eastwood has infused the picture with a typically deliberate and methodical feel that certainly complements Brian Helgeland's somewhat drawn-out screenplay...
Mystic River,Kevin Carr,7M Pictures,6.0,2012-7-21,"The entire cast did a phenomenal job, resisting the urge to overact too much, which is what you get for a film like this."
Mystic River,Nell Minow,Common Sense Media,6.0,2010-12-26,Powerful performances in graphic story. Only 16+.
Mystic River,Joe Lozito,Big Picture Big Sound,7.5,2007-7-14,"Mystic falters occasionally, but I respect its effort and I'm happy to see Mr. Eastwood growing as a director."
Mystic River,Alan Morrison,Empire Magazine,8.0,2006-12-30,"While not quite the equal of the novel, it's more complex, emotionally-charged and better acted than the average Hollywood thriller."
Mystic River,Betsy Bozdech,DVDJournal.com,10.0,2006-10-29,"Something modern Hollywood doesn't see every day: a veritable perfect storm of intelligent, grown-up dramatic movie-making."
Mystic River,Wesley Lovell,Cinema Sight,7.5,2006-8-8,"With characters that don't belong in the film and resolutions that seem mere fantasy, Mystic River never surpasses adequacy."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,7.5,2021-12-8,...a marked departure for the watchable yet thoroughly bland series...
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,7.0,2020-9-29,"Definitely not foolproof, like almost every time travel explanation, but this film nevertheless presents a new, creative angle."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Guillem Martinez Oya,Cinematismo,8.0,2019-7-11,Good film directed for a teenage audience in which not only is magic taught but also how stereotypes affect it while the film itself recreates some British stereotypes. [Review in Spanish]

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Dan Webster,Spokesman-Review (Washington),8.75,2014-11-16,"You could call this one Harry Potter Grows Up.

Children of Men,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-2-12,"Children of Men is an achingly, almost dreamily optimistic film in the face of such brutally cynical conditions, offering a humanist message that neutralizes political debate."

Children of Men,Ray Pride,Newcity,10.0,2020-5-17,"Children of Men is concentrated cinema, wrought, focused, emblematic.... Cuarón [is] equally concerned with the survival of richly detailed cinema as the fraught voyage of his encircled, besieged characters."

Children of Men,Millicent Thomas,Screen Queens,8.0,2018-11-10,"It is simultaneously soul-crushing and spirit-lifting. Watching twelve years after its release, the potent themes of immigration, border control, and seeking humanity in others means Children of Men remains more timely than ever."

Almost Famous,Peter Travers,Rolling Stone,10.0,2024-3-26,"If you haven't already sold your soul to rock & roll, Almost Famous should seal the deal. It’s pure pleasure.

Almost Famous,Roger Ebert,Chicago Sun-Times,10.0,2024-3-26,"Oh, what a lovely film. I was almost hugging myself while I watched it."
Almost Famous,Wesley Morris,San Francisco Examiner,8.75,2024-3-26,"Resistance to the euphoric swell is futile: suddenly, vintage Elton is unselfconsciously cool again. That's what Crowe can do at his best. He makes irony seem ridiculous, which itself is beautifully ironic for someone trying to keep rock alive."
Almost Famous,John Griffin,Montreal Gazette,10.0,2024-3-26,"This is the 43-year-old Crowe’s family album, the equivalent of a supergroup tribute to the people who set him on his path in life. It is a love letter from a fan, and it is written from the heart."
Almost Famous,Michael Wilmington,Chicago Tribune,10.0,2024-3-26,"It rocks hard and sweetly, making that past live and sing for us. I loved this movie madly, and so will many of you."
Almost Famous,John Anderson,Newsday,6.25,2024-3-26,Almost Famous is a case study in the decline of music and movies. Both want to keep the fun in profundity. But neither has figured out how to have it both ways.
Almost Famous,Rene Rodriguez,Miami Herald,10.0,2024-3-26,"It doesn't have the obsessive, closed-in feel that mars many personal projects. You don't even have to like rock and roll to enjoy it. You just have to like people, which Crowe obviously does."
Almost Famous,Carrie Rickey,Philadelphia Inquirer,7.5,2024-3-26,"A not-quite-great but thoroughly enchanting memoir. Raggedy as the clothes and shaggy as the coifs sported by its characters, it is the movie equivalent of A Sentimental Education."
Almost Famous,Jack Mathews,New York Daily News,10.0,2024-3-26,"The real achievement of Almost Famous is its point of view -- that sense of passion and discovery that imbued Crowe and now spills out, unpolluted, onto the screen."
Almost Famous,Peter Keough,Boston Phoenix,7.5,2024-3-26,"At least as far as its passion is concerned, Almost Famous is almost perfect."
Almost Famous,Chris Garcia,Austin American-Statesman,7.5,2024-3-26,"An optimist who ministers doughy affirmations instead of insight, Crowe had made a frustratingly minor film, whose superficial delights are plentiful and lasting rewards scarce."

Boogie Nights,Mike Clark,USA Today,10.0,2018-1-10,"The pop 1970s were typified in part by cheesy fashions, ephemeral music and a regular diet of daring, cutting-edge movies that arguably made that decade Hollywood's richest. Blistering Boogie Nights recaptures the spirit of that time on all three counts."
Boogie Nights,Renee Schonfeld,Common Sense Media,8.0,2012-7-25,"Unflinching look at porn industry; lots of sex, drugs."

Once Were Warriors,Leigh Paatsch,Herald Sun (Australia),10.0,2020-4-23,One of the finest films ever made on New Zealand soil has lost none of its raw emotional power and unbearable psychological intensity.
Once Were Warriors,Jami Bernard,New York Daily News,8.75,2017-2-21,Once Were Warriors has more to say than the traditional TV-movie about spousal abuse. But some viewers will have to pay a price: This is a movie that requires strength and fortitude to sit through.
Once Were Warriors,John Hartl,Seattle Times,8.75,2017-2-21,"Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell, who plays Grace, had never acted before, and neither have a couple of the other key players. But under the careful direction of television veteran Lee Tamahori, they all do credible and forceful work."

Edward Scissorhands,Christopher Lloyd,The Film Yap,10.0,2023-6-26,Tim Burton's most iconic film is a fairy tale about the way art is used to reflect on both traditional society and the artist's inability to fit into it.
Edward Scissorhands,Henry Sheehan,Chicago Reader,7.5,2022-5-24,Edward Scissorhands is a flashy and entertaining apologia from an artist who has not accumulated enough work to justify such self-concern.
Edward Scissorhands,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,8.75,2020-9-7,"Long a courageous actor, Depp inhabits a character that by all accounts should have been a freak or caricature."

Edward Scissorhands,Matt Brunson,Creative Loafing,6.25,2015-10-24,"Depp cuts a haunting figure, while Wiest is typically excellent. The rest of the actors are forced to play characters who are either underdeveloped or overcooked, and the broadness of Burton's approach eventually leads to a wholly unsatisfying resolution."
Edward Scissorhands,Marc Lee,Daily Telegraph (UK),10.0,2014-12-17,"Burton's modern fairytale has an almost palpably personal feel: it is told gently, subtly and with infinite sympathy for an outsider who charms the locals but then inadvertently arouses their baser instincts."

Hannah and Her Sisters,Gene Siskel,Chicago Tribune,10.0,2014-2-10,The marvel of Hannah and Her Sisters is just how many fully realized characters and relationships Allen is able to weave into the fabric of this extraordinarily well-written film. This script is one to be studied by aspiring filmmakers.
Hannah and Her Sisters,Desmond Ryan,Philadelphia Inquirer,10.0,2014-2-10,Hannah and Her Sisters is also filmmaking of consummate skill and emotional range. It encompasses brilliant comedy and almost unbearable poignance -- often in the same scene.

This Is Spinal Tap,Peter Canavese,Groucho Reviews,10.0,2009-7-28,"The story of an embarrasingly inept heavy-metal band called Spinal Tap, Rob Reiner's film set the mockumentary standard that has come to define much of modern screen comedy. [Blu-ray]"
This Is Spinal Tap,David N. Butterworth,rec.arts.movies.reviews,8.75,2008-10-18,Scores an 11 (out of 10) for sheer inspired lunacy but it's the writers' unexpected fondness for their subject matter that puts the film in a class all its own.
The Blues Brothers,Victoria Luxford,BBC.com,10.0,2023-8-24,One of the great American comedy films... It’s just a joy to watch even forty three years on.  John Belushi was never better as the lead. He’s funny just standing there.
The Blues Brothers,Gene Siskel,Chicago Tribune,10.0,2020-12-21,"The Blues Brothers is the year's best film to date; one of the, all-time great comedies; the best movie ever made in Chicago. All are true, and, boy, is that ever a surprise."

Dawn of the Dead,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,7.0,2022-8-17,"Their spin on “Dawn of the Dead” lacks the sly humor and satirical bite that was a pivotal part of Romero’s movie. But it’s far from humorless and the big action, creepy setting, and snappy pacing keeps things engaging."
Dawn of the Dead,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,7.5,2022-2-17,"No matter how much the genre has been beaten to death in the years since its release, Snyder's remake is enduringly scary, thrilling, and incurably watchable time after time. It remains his best film."

Dawn of the Dead,Joe Lipsett,Horror Queers Podcast,9.0,2021-5-21,"Far and away Snyder's best film, the remake deftly pays homage to its predecessor while charting its own path. Scary, with great set pieces and a nihilistic ending, the film's only letdown is its zombie baby subplot, which is DOA."

In the Heat of the Night,Don Shanahan,Every Movie Has a Lesson,10.0,2023-9-4,"Even without the racial overtones that makes the film historic, ""In the Heat of the Night"" is a top-notch and superior mystery film and crime drama.  That strength of story and intrigue only adds to the tangible racial tension of the setting."
In the Heat of the Night,Roger Moore,Movie Nation,10.0,2023-1-23,"How in the Hell did they not nominate Sidney Poitier for this, the jewel in his acting crown? Even if he had a statuette already on his mantelpiece, the omission is as glaring as the film’s Southern Racism — then and now — messaging."

Hiroshima mon amour,James Berardinelli,ReelViews,7.5,2021-7-12,"I was arrested by the way in which the film was shot and what it was saying, but I'll admit to not caring much about the two people at the center of Resnais' drama."
Hiroshima mon amour,Nicholas Bell,IONCINEMA.com,8.0,2020-10-21,"A stunning piece of cinema, Hiroshima Mon Amour is also one of Resnais' most emotionally affecting pieces, for one cannot help but be moved by these lovelorn people, struggling hopelessly against the onslaught of time and the doom of being forgotten."

Strangers on a Train,Trace Thurman,Horror Queers Podcast,8.0,2024-3-18,"Despite some questionable changes from Patricia Highsmith's source material, Strangers on a Train showcases Hitchcock at his most gleeful, emphatically building suspense before an explosive climax."
Strangers on a Train,Joe Lipsett,Horror Queers Podcast,9.0,2024-3-13,"Hitchcock frequently subverts expectations, particularly in how he involves secondary characters.

His Girl Friday,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,10.0,2023-4-4,"One of the all-time great motion pictures -- if anyone ever elects to place a screwball comedy in a time capsule for 25th-century historians to analyze, it might as well be this one."
His Girl Friday,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-3-18,"A film resting on the speed and timing of its delivery, as well as the talent of Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, His Girl Friday remains a whimsical classic whose sheer velocity earned Hawks boasting rights over Milestone's earlier version."
His Girl Friday,Kate Cameron,New York Daily News,8.75,2021-10-14,"The picture is a blessed relief from most of the solemn and oppressively sad stories that have been occupying New York screens since before the holidays, and it moves Rosalind Russell to the very top of the roster of Hollywood's cleverest comediennes."
King Kong,Danielle Solzman,Solzy at the Movies,9.0,2023-9-27,Peter Jackson draws on the original 1933 classic in his 2005 remake of King Kong and the film is every bit the epic that one would expect.
King Kong,Arnold Wayne Jones,Texas Triangle/TXT,8.75,2023-5-7,"The visual effects are glorious -- a circus of cliffhanging suspense sequences that go on and on and on.

King Kong,Film4 Staff,Film4,8.0,2011-5-29,"As it is a remake, it doesn't have the shock Lord Of The Rings possessed upon its release, but this is a beautiful beast of a B-movie, thrilling and touching."

Freaks,Jonathan Hatfull,SciFiNow,10.0,2015-6-18,"With strong performances and a surprising tenderness, Freaks more than deserves its towering reputation."

Nosferatu,Kate Cameron,New York Daily News,5.0,2021-1-8,"The action of the picture is so disconnected as to make the continuity confusing. However, this one certainly holds interest, for its extreme weirdness and its unusual photography."
Nosferatu,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,10.0,2020-10-28,Nosferatu remains the best vampire movie of all time. It possesses a strain of sheer dread not captured by any subsequent bloodsucker film.
Nosferatu,PJ Nabarro,Patrick Nabarro,10.0,2019-11-1,"Completely lacking in gratuity and malice: it creates all of its dramatic effect from the simple interplay between light and dark, and the suggestion of Nosferatu's diabolism."

Nosferatu,Noel Murray,The Dissolve,8.0,2013-11-19,"The movie's best effect is its star...He looks every bit like an actual demonic wild-thing, retrieved from deep within the German wilderness and trotted out to perform for Murnau's camera."

The Gentlemen,Bianca Garner,Next Best Picture,6.0,2021-5-5,A strong ensemble cast with Hugh Grant like you've never seen him before. Plus Ritchie proves why he's the guv'nor of the British Gangster flick.

The Gentlemen,Mark Meszoros,"The News-Herald (Willoughby, OH)",6.25,2021-2-28,"Like the vast majority of Ritchie's work, The Gentlemen is both entertaining and almost instantly forgettable"
The Gentlemen,Lindsay Traves,CGMagazine,7.0,2021-2-24,"The cast is top notch and everyone is on their A-game, and it gives more fodder for Sons of Anarchy fans to boast about what Hunnam can do when he's directed well."

The Gentlemen,Nicole Ackman,In Their Own League,5.0,2021-2-2,"But it feels sloppily made without a coherent tone and while there are some great performances, they don't entirely work next to each other."
The Gentlemen,Richard Crouse,Richard Crouse,5.0,2021-1-30,"As rock 'n rolling as the filmmaking is, the story acts as an anchor, bogging things down as it gets more and more convoluted."

Raazi,Tom Cassidy,Common Sense Media,6.0,2022-12-14,"The turmoil that regular student Sehmat goes through after she's plucked from her studies and trained as a spy is what makes the film such a thoughtful reflection on the horrors of war, rather than an action-packed espionage thriller."
Raazi,Anna M.M. Vetticad,Firstpost,9.0,2021-1-9,"Raazi is an espionage venture with heart and soul tempering its gritty core. Even as it kept me on the edge of my seat for its entire 140 minutes, it broke my heart."
Raazi,Rahul Desai,Film Companion,8.0,2018-8-30,"Raazi is an excellent film because of how easily it could have not been one. On another day, this might have well been a jingoistic Neeraj Pandey actioner called Naam Sehmat."

Sound of Metal,Cris Kennedy,The Canberra Times (Australia),8.0,2022-8-16,"Sound of Metal's explorations of grief, acceptance and of progression are a rewarding experience and as we've all just spent the better part of a year learning to accept and adapt to change foisted upon us, the film's messages are additionally resonant."
Sound of Metal,Victoria Luxford,City AM,8.0,2022-3-2,"Sound of Metal occasionally gets lost in the visual flourishes, but this is a small gripe when compared to a performance that reveals an actor hitting his stride as an artist."

Dunkirk,Roger Moore,Movie Nation,5.0,2021-4-27,"It's a dry, almost lifeless account, with even the deaths seeming stodgy and silent-film-acting melodramatic."
Dunkirk,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,8.75,2020-4-18,"Perhaps surprisingly, this older Dunkirk is less sentimental and more cynical than the Christopher Nolan blockbuster."
Perfetti sconosciuti,Sebastian Zavala Kahn,Me gusta el cine,7.5,2017-8-22,"A tragicomedy full of truly hilarious moments, a well-acted film that manages to develop an interesting premise very intelligently during at least the first sixty minutes of footage. [Full review in Spanish]"

Atonement,Matthew Pejkovic,Matt's Movie Reviews,8.0,2010-7-7,"An epic, grandiose, and immensely sad film, Atonement is an extremely well crafted, visually rich love story set during a tumultuous time of war, where two impassioned characters are forever torn apart by the selfish jealousy of another."
Atonement,Mike Scott,Times-Picayune,6.25,2009-7-27,"Frustratingly uneven, struggling to maintain momentum as it lurches through extended lulls and indulges in cliched genre affectations."

American Gangster,Justin Brown,Medium Popcorn,10.0,2022-11-20,"Despite having a personal connection to the story in this film, I also love this movie for the dialogue, performances (particularly Denzel's) and the music."
American Gangster,Brandon Collins,Medium Popcorn,8.0,2022-11-20,Very solid performances anchored by Denzel. I think they could have trimmed 15-20 minutes of the Russell Crowe storyline and it would have been a near perfect film.

American Gangster,Ali Gray,TheShiznit.co.uk,6.0,2012-11-3,"Though it's certainly admirable to aim high, it's like Frank Lucas himself says: ""Either you're somebody, or you ain't nobody."" Unfortunately for American Gangster, it ends up somewhere between the two."
American Gangster,Alex Fletcher,Digital Spy,8.0,2011-7-14,"It's 157 minutes long, but immerses its audience with its twists and intricacies as it plays out and considers the logistics and consequences of crime and police corruption, with a plethora of show-stealing performances from the cast."

American Gangster,Alonso Duralde,MSNBC,4.0,2008-5-1,Telling a true story doesn't excuse a filmmaker from making his movie stand out from the many others that have traversed similar ground.
American Gangster,Jeff Bayer,The Scorecard Review,7.0,2008-3-4,"It feels familiar, even Washington's performance of real-life Frank Lucas feels like something we've seen before."
American Gangster,Brandon Fibbs,Colorado Springs Gazette,6.0,2008-2-28,"It isn't that American Gangster is an empirically bad film or is even unenjoyable. But don't be surprised if, when you walk out of the theater, you forget the film ever existed."

Apocalypto,Matthew Pejkovic,Matt's Movie Reviews,8.0,2010-7-6,"Shot with digital camera on location in Mexico, Mel Gibson has created a visually stunning action/adventure epic that although has divided many with its historical accuracy, has spared no expense in bringing life to a world before European colonization."
Apocalypto,Felix Vasquez Jr.,Cinema Crazed,8.75,2009-4-29,"All in all Apocalypto is probably Gibson's best film to date, because it's almost free of any of Hollywood's tainting."
Apocalypto,Peter Keough,Boston Phoenix,6.25,2009-4-23,"The middle of the film, though, finds Gibson at his sadistic best, depicting monumental savagery with a surreal cinematic glee that puts the Apocalypse in Apocalypto."

Apocalypto,Anton Bitel,Projected Figures,7.0,2007-6-12,"All at once reconstruction of a lost empire, ripping boy’s own adventure, and eschatological allegory, Mel Gibson’s Mayan movie comes as something of a Revelation."

Little Miss Sunshine,Leigh Paatsch,Herald Sun (Australia),8.0,2020-8-11,The most unlikely (and effective) feelgood movie you might ever see.
Little Miss Sunshine,Danielle Solzman,Solzy at the Movies,10.0,2019-7-26,Little Miss Sunshine is one of the film festival gems that is just as smart and funny so many years later.
Little Miss Sunshine,Mattie Lucas,"The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)",10.0,2019-6-5,"Like a little ray of sunshine in a world of bland, boring, reheated movies that clog up the arteries of our nation's theaters."
Little Miss Sunshine,Namrata Joshi,Outlook,7.5,2019-1-24,"The best thing about American cinema is that besides the studio-assembled big ticket movies, there's also the flourishing indie film movement which keeps throwing up some delightfully refreshing movies."
Little Miss Sunshine,Jamie Gillies,Apollo Guide,8.6,2009-10-1,"While the screenplay is impressive and deserving of its recognition, it is Alan Arkin's performance-of-a-lifetime that separates this from other well-written small movies."
Little Miss Sunshine,Gabe Leibowitz,Film and Felt,4.8,2009-9-19,"Harmless enough as passable road movies go, but I can't help but wish directors of films like these would grow some damn balls."
Little Miss Sunshine,Felix Vasquez Jr.,Cinema Crazed,8.75,2009-4-29,"I loved it, every bit of it."
Little Miss Sunshine,Peter Keough,Boston Phoenix,6.25,2009-4-23,"Like little kids spouting dirty words in certain comedies, this film from first-time directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris undermines the subversive with the self-conscious. But it's still funny."
Little Miss Sunshine,Brian Marder,Hollywood.com,10.0,2008-11-20,"This inspirational, hilariously sad dysfunctional-family-road-trip dramedy offers absolutely everything -- except pretension."
Little Miss Sunshine,Jonathan Kiefer,Sacramento News & Review,6.0,2008-8-7,"A few touching and surprising moments aside, it all feels a little prefab, with family dysfunction as the indie version of a high concept."
Little Miss Sunshine,Amber Wilkinson,Eye for Film,8.0,2008-6-13,Writer Michael Arndt has cleverly captured the bribery and corruption which lie at the heart of most families.
Hot Fuzz,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2024-3-8,"This is great filmmaking and storytelling that just so happens to allude to other action movies in its construction. And quite frankly, it’s greatly entertaining in both the comedic and action realms, far surpassing its referenced sources."
Hot Fuzz,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,7.5,2021-10-3,"An amusing comedy that also manages to evoke memories of The Wicker Man, Plague of the Zombies, and other spooky yarns centering on eccentric villagers inhabiting the less-traveled paths of the British Isles."
Hot Fuzz,Wesley Lovell,Cinema Sight,8.75,2020-12-16,You'll never think of the cop buddy genre the same way again.

Hot Fuzz,Kevin Carr,7M Pictures,8.0,2014-1-19,"Manages to find humor not just in the mundane existence of a small town but also in the overblown nature of action films. And, it works as an action movie on its own."

Hot Fuzz,Gabe Leibowitz,Film and Felt,7.0,2011-3-13,"Hot Fuzz, Edgar Wright's follow-up to his extremely popular zombie satire Shaun of the Dead (2004), improves on the latter's strong points in every conceivable way while drastically tightening up its weakest elements."
Hot Fuzz,Ian Buckwalter,DCist,9.0,2010-6-9,Works because they set out to make a faithful genre picture just as equally as a comedy. The film is even funnier because they never sacrifice plot or character for a laugh.
Hot Fuzz,Jeff Bayer,The Scorecard Review,7.0,2008-9-4,"The makers of Shaun of the Dead have done it again. This time they have combined a classic cop-buddy movie with a quaint town in England, and yes, laughs definitely ensue."
Hot Fuzz,Jonathan Kiefer,Sacramento News & Review,8.0,2008-8-7,"It's overlong and not always precisely on target but neither self-congratulating nor condescending -- and a fine, funny contribution to English-American mutual amusement besides."

Serenity,Aaron Peterson,The Hollywood Outsider,10.0,2018-10-25,"Thank you, [Joss], for creating this world, for seeing it through, and for giving us die-hard fans the closure we so desperately needed. You just earned yourself a lifetime pass from geeks everywhere."

Serenity,Jeffrey Lyles,Lyles' Movie Files,8.0,2012-8-10,"After suffering through a summer crammed with TV shows being remade into movies, it's refreshing to see a movie based on a TV show that is so entertaining that it actually makes you want to go and see the show of which the movie was created."
Serenity,Joshua Starnes,ComingSoon.net,7.0,2011-3-30,"New viewers will be a little bit lost, and old fans won't get quite everything they wanted, but there's enough going on in Serenity and it's all so much fun that it doesn't matter."
Serenity,Keith H. Brown,Eye for Film,5.0,2008-10-18,In the end you are left with the feeling that Whedon works better on television than in the cinema.
Serenity,Todd Hertz,Christianity Today,7.5,2006-8-31,"Firefly finally has the triumphant finale fans longed for: the excitingly tense, often surprising and even more frequently comical Serenity. Fans will rejoice."
Serenity,Jim Lane,Sacramento News & Review,8.0,2006-5-12,"The movie is a sci-fi buccaneer swashbuckler; Whedon hits all the obligatory space-opera notes, and he does it with a degree of verbal wit and agile pacing that could teach George Lucas a thing or two."
Walk the Line,Rachel Wagner,rachelsreviews.net,9.0,2019-2-28,I love this movie so much.
Walk the Line,Namrata Joshi,Outlook,7.5,2019-1-10,"The film boasts of extremely competent performances, particularly the extraordinary Phoenix. As for Witherspoon, with her nasal twang and perky persona, she is sweet and sassy..."

The Notebook,Mark Jackson,Epoch Times,8.0,2023-4-21,A tearjerker? It'll make you cry but it's not manipulative. A chick flick? It's just an inspiring love story that will touch your heart and make you believe true love can last a lifetime and conquer all. Isn't that what we all want?
The Notebook,Patrick McDonald,HollywoodChicago.com,7.0,2023-2-25,"There is always cinema room for the unabashed tearjerker, & THE N delivers on that ""note.""

The Notebook,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,8.0,2020-11-7,"Though torn between two storylines, one of which vastly outshines the other, ""The Notebook"" is still an impressive production."
The Notebook,PJ Nabarro,Patrick Nabarro,4.0,2019-10-31,James Garner and Gena Rowlands lend the story a graceful gravity that perhaps the rest of the film's more simplistic romanticism doesn't deserve.
The Notebook,Mattie Lucas,"The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)",5.0,2019-6-5,Never quite escapes the been-there-done-that feeling of Hollywood romantic cliché with sunny photography and perfectly tailored costumes to boot.
The Notebook,Kaleem Aftab,The List,6.0,2019-4-18,Frank Capra would be proud of the way Nick Cassavetes pulls at the heart strings... Have tissues at the ready.
The Notebook,Megan Spencer,sbs.com.au,5.0,2019-2-2,"The Notebook is the kind of syrupy, heightened melodrama more likely to be found in the pages of a Mills & Boon paperback than on the silver screen."

Waking Life,Nick Rogers,Midwest Film Journal,10.0,2010-11-22,"A far-out-man poetry slam, art exhibit and imaginative philosophical discourse all at once drifts gently down a stream of consciousness until merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, ""Waking Life"" is but a dream.

Waking Life,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,2.5,2006-7-1,"The novelty of the much-lauded animation style wears off about halfway through, with the end result a film that's more interminable than anything else."
Waking Life,Steven Snyder,Zertinet Movies,10.0,2005-10-1,"It is not the best film of the year, nor is it likely to be one that I purchase and watch often. Still, it is something that should be seen by everyone and experienced by any diehard film lover."

Remember the Titans,Roger Clarke,Independent (UK),4.0,2024-3-26,"This is certainly full of worthy thoughts and intentions; but, in the end, Americans just don't seem to understand that American football seems as bizarre to most of the world as Eton Fives."
Remember the Titans,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,7.0,2022-8-24,The beating heart of the story is still powerful and pertinent which makes this film not only highly watchable entertainment but a thought-provoking (and hopefully in some ways enlightening) crowdpleaser.

Remember the Titans,Nick Rogers,Midwest Film Journal,8.75,2010-9-17,"The crack-of-dawn jog to Gettysburg is the only hokey Hail Mary in an otherwise smart, stirring sports film.

Cast Away,Nick Rogers,Midwest Film Journal,10.0,2010-9-25,"As melancholy as it is affirming, ""Cast Away"" tells a darkly comic, occasionally punishing parable about what happens when humans lose sight of humility in life's grand scheme - an interesting thematic twin to Tom Hanks' own ""Joe vs. the Volcano."""

Shrek,Peter Canavese,Celluloid Dreams,8.75,2021-5-8,Classic fairy tale fantasy. (In some ways this 20th Anniversary Special Edition 4K HD blu-ray release sharpens the relatively early [2001] CGI animation highlighting the processes flaws).

Titanic,Danielle Solzman,Solzy at the Movies,9.0,2023-6-26,"The fact that we're still talking about Titanic over 25 years after its release speaks to the film and ship's staying power. Some issues with the fictional love story not withstanding, Titanic remains an epic achievement in filmmaking."
Titanic,Sebastian Zavala Kahn,Me gusta el cine,10.0,2023-2-17,"James Cameron knows what he's doing, and with “Titanic”, he made a modern classic; simple and archetypal, but powerful. I'm sure I'll end up seeing it again (in 6K, 8K or even as a hologram) in five, ten, or even thirty years. Full review in Spanish."

Titanic,Stephen Silver,Tilt Magazine,9.0,2022-12-27,"The biggest decision that guaranteed Titanic’s success was the casting of the two leads. Neither was a particularly huge star when the movie was being put together in 1996, but their chemistry was electric. (25th anniversary)"
Titanic,Don Shanahan,25YL (25 Years Later),10.0,2022-12-25,The film brought the old legend to life and stoked an emotional windfall that has never been seen in movies before or since.
Gattaca,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,7.5,2023-1-24,"The writer-director crafts a paranoid, discriminatory world out of ripped-from-the-headlines science. Adopting a noirish mood amid an austere dystopian backdrop, it’s the sort of Orwellian vision that could only exist in a movie."
Gattaca,Jimmy Cage,Jimmy Cage Movie Reviews (YouTube),8.0,2022-12-18,"A fascinating sci-fi drama that has stood the test of time with ease. The dense, romantic, somber atmosphere fits perfectly with the eerie topic that is incredibly close to us."

The Game,Niall Browne,Movies in Focus,8.0,2021-6-24,The Game is possibly David Fincher's finest movie (or at least a close second to Zodiac) and it is a pity that it is sandwiched between Se7en and Fight Club
The Game,Kevin Maher,Times (UK),8.0,2021-6-7,"It looks stunning, with every shadowy scene seemingly dipped in ink and some rapid-fire edits balanced by more experimental touches (super slow-mo squash, anyone?)."
The Game,Marianna Neal,Impression Blend,7.0,2020-12-17,"There is certainly plenty to appreciate here, but the issues of this particular story are just too significant to overlook."
The Game,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,9.0,2020-9-13,"The plausibility of the whole thing is ludicrously farfetched, but that's the point - and the fun."
The Game,PJ Nabarro,Patrick Nabarro,6.0,2019-10-31,"A classy thriller, and yet further evidence of how Michael Douglas was able to nail these WASP-in-peril roles."
The Game,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,8.75,2017-10-22,...a top-tier thriller that doesn't always seem to get the respect and admiration it clearly deserves.

The Game,Matt Brunson,Creative Loafing,6.25,2012-9-26,"This is one of those movies that's so tightly written and densely plotted, it leaves no room for error -- or viewer queries. Unfortunately, the questions will start flying even before the picture's over."

Breaking the Waves,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,8.0,2023-8-4,"Von Trier’s patent insincerity and facetiousness could be read as a satire on movie emotionalism, or as its own kind of conceptual art. Either way, it’s quite an experience."
Breaking the Waves,Barbara Shulgasser,Common Sense Media,4.0,2017-4-18,"Gloomy '90s drama has cursing, nudity, mature themes."
Breaking the Waves,Christopher Long,Movie Metropolis,10.0,2014-8-3,Both a ferocious love story and a tale of the triumph of vital individual faith over ossified and corrupt organized religion.
Breaking the Waves,Matt Brunson,Creative Loafing,8.75,2014-4-18,"Issues of faith, devotion, sexuality and divine intervention are at the center of this daring and provocative piece that placed writer-director Lars von Trier on the international map."
Breaking the Waves,Scott Tobias,The Dissolve,9.0,2014-4-15,"It's a testament to Emily Watson's astounding performance as Bess that she comes across as more than a von Trier construct; she's a woman of boundless passion, who follows her faith wherever it takes her."
Breaking the Waves,Michael Dequina,TheMovieReport.com,8.75,2005-9-15,The synopsis doesn't begin to do justice to the psychological and emotional complexities of the tale.

Ed Wood,Sean P. Means,Salt Lake Tribune,6.25,2024-1-19,"What happens when a good filmmaker tries to make a great film about a terrible filmmaker. In the case of Tim Burton's Ed Wood, you get an odd and oddly unsatisfying film with occasional flourishes of brilliance."
Ed Wood,Jack Garner,Rochester Democrat and Chronicle,9.0,2024-1-19,"The film is not only a hilarious satire of Wood and his low-budget antics, but also a loving paean to dreamers everywhere."

Ed Wood,David Gonzalez,The Cinematic Reel,10.0,2022-2-14,"Winner of two Academy Awards including Best Supporting Actor and Best Makeup, the irony in Ed Wood is that the worst director of all time brought out the best of the man and what many consider Tim Burtons best film."

Tombstone,Erik Childress,The Friendship Dilemma Podcast,6.25,2022-9-29,Val Kilmer's performance is legendary and a likely reason this film is more fondly remembered as a modern western classic rather than the mess it ultimately becomes in trying to tell a full piece of the legend.

Boyz n the Hood,Neil Smith,Total Film,8.0,2016-10-24,"Singleton was only 23 when he made this urgent state-of-the-nation drama. But his skill with the camera, handling of actors, and raw dialogue suggests a seasoned pro."

The Killing Fields,Adrian Turner,Radio Times,10.0,2015-9-16,Few feature films have captured a nation's agony more dramatically than Roland Joff's The Killing Fields.
The Killing Fields,Dan Jardine,Cinemania,8.2,2015-1-9,Ngor's naturalistic and empathic portrayal of his character's desperate fight for survival is the key to this film's visceral power.
The Killing Fields,Matt Brunson,Creative Loafing,10.0,2014-1-15,"One of the great films from what proved to be a great year for cinema, The Killing Fields hasn't lost any of its power over the ensuing 30 years."
The Killing Fields,Noel Murray,The Dissolve,8.0,2014-1-13,Every scene of The Killing Fields (and every participant in its making) is in service of showing how abruptly a seemingly safe and vital individual can have everything essential stripped away.
The Killing Fields,Pablo Villaça,Cinema em Cena,8.0,2009-4-15,"Se a primeira metade impressiona pelo virtuosismo tcnico, a segunda fascina pela coragem em observar sem sensacionalismo a magnfica fora de vontade de um sobrevivente, beneficiando-se ainda da maravilhosa performance semi-auto-biogrfica de Ngor."
The Killing Fields,David Kaplan,Kaplan vs. Kaplan,10.0,2008-3-1,
Ghostbusters,Justin Brown,Medium Popcorn,4.0,2022-11-20,"A part of me was for this film because I had enjoyed the cartoon series so much. This movie on its own is just ""ok""."
Ghostbusters,Brandon Collins,Medium Popcorn,4.0,2022-11-20,This has a long legacy in cinema that is worth considering but I surprisingly didn't enjoy rewatching this. I found myself shrugging my shoulders a lot and being bothered by Winston's character arc or lack thereof.
Ghostbusters,Zoë Rose Bryant,Loud and Clear Reviews,8.0,2022-9-1,Ghostbusters galvanized the comedy genre as a ferociously funny fable with state-of-the-art special effects and scares to spare.
Ghostbusters,David Gonzalez,The Cinematic Reel,10.0,2022-2-18,"While Ghostbusters II failed to have the same effect on me, it will take nothing away from the greatness of this film and is one of my personal top 10 films of all time. Ghostbusters is the definition of a classic."
Ghostbusters,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,7.0,2020-9-6,"It's the thrills of wraith-combating, action-packed citywide devastation, and carefree attitudes that highlight the adventures and give the film a strong sense of originality."
Ghostbusters,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,7.5,2016-7-15,...an erratic yet consistently entertaining summer blockbuster...
Ghostbusters,Joseph Gelmis,Newsday,7.5,2016-6-8,Ghostbusters is like romping through Disneyland's haunted house with Bill Murray.
Ghostbusters,Kathleen Carroll,New York Daily News,7.5,2015-6-16,"Ghostbusters is primarily a showcase for Murray, who slinks through the movie muttering his lines in his usual cheeky fashion and getting off an occasionally hilarious crack that proves he's thoroughly enjoying himself."
Ghostbusters,Scott Nash,Three Movie Buffs,10.0,2015-6-16,It's almost impossible not to smile while watching it.
Ghostbusters,Kate Muir,Times (UK),8.0,2014-10-31,Part of the sheer joy of this movie -- aside from the comic timing of Bill Murray -- is the cartoonish crapness of its apparitions and their placid acceptance by the Ghostbusters team.
Ghostbusters,Brian Henry Martin,UTV,7.0,2014-10-29,What you realise about Ghostbusters thirty years on is that Bill Murray is a comedy genius.

The Right Stuff,Matt Brunson,Creative Loafing,10.0,2013-11-6,"A great movie that unfortunately failed to attract audiences back in '83, this adaptation of Tom Wolfe's book about astronauts pays tribute to what we would like to believe represents the American spirit: hard work, perseverance, camaraderie and vision."
The Right Stuff,Film4 Staff,Film4,10.0,2011-10-5,"History, melodrama, comedy and satire are skilfully combined in this consistently exciting adventure.

Days of Heaven,Kevin Maher,Times (UK),10.0,2024-2-2,"The plague of locusts scene, achieved by dumping thousands of peanut shells from a helicopter and playing the eventual footage backwards, is a knockout."
Days of Heaven,Sara Michelle Fetters,MovieFreak.com,10.0,2023-10-19,"Terrence Malick’s ethereal, windswept ballad of love, lust, and nature’s wrath remains an otherworldly triumph."
Days of Heaven,Wesley Lovell,Cinema Sight,7.5,2023-10-4,"“Days of Heaven” is a good movie with a lot of artistic elements, but at times feels like it is a little lost in its intended journey."
Days of Heaven,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-20,"Alongside the unforgettable cinematography sits Ennio Morricone’s soulful, aching score. It is impeccably in tune with Malick’s vision and is among some of the late composer’s most timeless work."
Days of Heaven,PJ Nabarro,Patrick Nabarro,10.0,2018-11-8,The peak moment of Malick's career where he found the perfect blend of a respectful command of storytelling versus the more abstract submission to a cinema of the senses.

Days of Heaven,David Sexton,London Evening Standard,10.0,2011-9-2,"Simply one of the most ravishing films ever made, luminous in a way that no other movie has been."
The Outlaw Josey Wales,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,7.0,2020-8-30,"A touch overlong, with coverage of events clearly borrowed from the techniques of Sergio Leone, but nevertheless a thrilling Western epic."
The Outlaw Josey Wales,Tony Sloman,Radio Times,8.0,2016-7-27,"Clint Eastwood seized the directorial reins from Phil Kaufman and fashioned this tough, sprawling post-Civil War western epic into something approaching a personal testament."
The Outlaw Josey Wales,Matt Brunson,Creative Loafing,8.75,2011-6-25,An important movie in the maturation of Clint Eastwood as both actor and director.
The Outlaw Josey Wales,Peter Canavese,Groucho Reviews,7.5,2011-5-30,"Though the story is pat...there's pleasure to be had in the memorable one-liners, the irreverent humor...and the Western action against the backdrop of frontier scenery. [Blu-ray]"

The Conversation,Stephen Silver,The SS Ben Hecht,10.0,2024-4-5,"Yes, Coppola made this between the first two Godfathers. But it's also important about the 1972/1974 interregnum is that it was the years between the Watergate break-in and Nixon's resignation (50th anniversary)"
The Conversation,Michael Clark,Epoch Times,10.0,2023-8-12,"Although lacking the epic sweep and operatic grandeur of the movies that bookended it, it more than makes up for it with spare, assured, and measured storytelling, supreme character development. It's the finest solo screenwriting of Coppola’s career."
The Conversation,Danielle Solzman,Solzy at the Movies,10.0,2023-3-22,There's a lot to be said about the fine line between privacy and technology but The Conversation is a timeless and provocative thriller.

The Conversation,Ray Pride,Newcity,10.0,2022-1-28,"Its hypnotic hold does not flag, no matter how many times you've seen it. Surveillance and guilt: secrets and sharers. Its paranoia matches that of any old denizen of our modern world."
The Conversation,Michael Phillips,Chicago Tribune,10.0,2022-1-28,"Its enveloping chill feels, looks and - crucially, in a story about a man who eavesdrops for a living - sounds as arresting as ever."
The Conversation,Ed Potton,Times (UK),10.0,2021-3-1,"Set against a claustrophobic backdrop of post-Watergate paranoia, Coppola's favourite of his films hinges on the intonation of a single word."
Badlands,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-19,It’s a well written tale of two lost souls dancing between idyllic naiveté and sociopathic violence. I couldn’t take my eyes off of it.
Badlands,PJ Nabarro,Patrick Nabarro,8.0,2018-11-10,"A masterly exercise in ironic narration, and of a director so wholly in command of the rhetoric of his medium."
Badlands,Christopher Long,Movie Metropolis,9.0,2013-5-22,This tender treatment does nothing to alleviate the horror of the atrocities committed.
Badlands,Joshua Rothkopf,Time Out,10.0,2013-5-7,"In the fall of 1973, one could see signposts of cinema's future in Mean Streets and The Exorcist, yet with this youthful pair of proto-indie dreamers, Malick was paving a whole new road. It turned out to be the path most traveled."
Badlands,Tina Hassannia,Slant Magazine,10.0,2013-5-5,It's a testament to Bruce Greenwood's acting that Adan never becomes entirely as insufferable as the words that come out of his mouth.
Badlands,Tim Brayton,Antagony & Ecstasy,10.0,2011-5-31,"Incredibly beautiful, of course (you may have heard that Malick movies are famous for their landscapes), but it's not ""just"" beautiful."

Cabaret,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,3.0,2020-8-27,The main characters' inebriated antics never seem to amount to anything potent or moving or simply involving.
Cabaret,Kim Newman,Empire Magazine,8.0,2020-6-12,Liza Minnelli and Joel Grey are electrifying; director Bob Fosse's choreography and the camera work are scintillating.
Cabaret,Tony Sloman,Radio Times,10.0,2020-6-12,"If brash Minnelli seems a mite too talented for the Sally Bowles character, it really doesn't matter: she is, quite simply, magnificent in this role."
Cabaret,Tim Brayton,Alternate Ending,10.0,2017-8-19,"A truly great movie adapted from truly great source material, but it achieves most of its greatness by thoroughly gutting and re-imagining that source."
Cabaret,Walter Chaw,Film Freak Central,10.0,2013-6-7,"It's an all-time masterpiece, mercurial and timeless. I am changed every time I see it."
Cabaret,Mike McGranaghan,Aisle Seat,8.75,2013-2-8,"Cabaret is in some respects a typical feel-good musical, yet it's also so much deeper than that."

Cabaret,James Wegg,JWR,9.0,2009-7-22,"Let's just say it: the best thing going in director Bob Fosse's tour de force is Joel Grey. As the Master of Ceremonies at the infamous Berlin Kit-Kat club, Grey steals every scene he's in and makes us hope for more."
Cabaret,Rich Cline,Shadows on the Wall,10.0,2008-4-20,simply masterful in every way
Midnight Cowboy,Michael Talbot-Haynes,Film Threat,10.0,2022-3-25,"The characters’ dreams and memories intermingle with their daily actions, sometimes combining in surreal ways. The camerawork is amazing, capturing vistas of glory and grime from the dawn of 1970s New York."
Midnight Cowboy,Sophie Monks Kaufman,Time Out,10.0,2022-3-14,Director John Schlesinger and screenwriter Waldo Salt pump so much emotion into it that it becomes a moving epitaph both to its two striving characters and the American dream itself.
Wait Until Dark,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,8.75,2022-12-30,The action is kept fluid and the suspense tight.
Wait Until Dark,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,10.0,2020-10-20,...a fairly timeless thriller that still ranks as one of the very best examples of the genre...
Wait Until Dark,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,8.0,2020-8-27,"While the conclusion is shocking (fulfilling the title as well as Susy's attempts to level the playing field), it's Arkin's performance that really leaves an impression."

Bonnie and Clyde,Matt Neal,ABC Radio (Australia),10.0,2021-9-12,"There is Hollywood before Bonnie & Clyde, and Hollywood after Bonnie & Clyde."
Bonnie and Clyde,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,10.0,2020-8-24,Beatty and Dunaway make one of the most memorable and sexy onscreen duos through obvious chemistry and a decidedly one-sided passion.
Mary Poppins,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,10.0,2024-3-28,"I have to admit that I find the real brilliance of the film is in the first act and things have wound down by the end, but what an entertainment sugar rush."
Mary Poppins,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,8.0,2020-8-27,"Combines supremely catchy songs, the forward and sarcastic dialogue of the unsurpassable Julie Andrews, and a psychedelic plot."
Mary Poppins,David Parkinson,Radio Times,10.0,2016-4-6,"This is easily the best of Disney's experiments in combining animation and live action, and one of the studio's best-loved films."
Mary Poppins,Martin Chilton,Daily Telegraph (UK),8.0,2015-1-1,Van Dyke's energy is prodigious (especially when he leaps around with a gang of sooty chimney-sweeps on the London rooftops) and the songs are classics.
Mary Poppins,Peter Canavese,Groucho Reviews,10.0,2013-12-9,"One of the great movie musicals and of that rare breed of deathless family entertainment that's guaranteed to transfix children, well beyond this, its fiftieth anniversary. [Blu-ray]"
Mary Poppins,Noel Murray,The Dissolve,9.0,2013-12-9,"Whether the movie's message is Travers-approved or not, the emphasis on joy and empathy proves heartening, even today."

Red River,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,8.0,2022-8-24,“Red River” stakes its claim as a true classic of the Western genre.
Red River,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-2-14,"For all the film's practicality and attention to detail, Red River is also an extraordinary story less concerned about propelling a standard Hollywood spectacle than its own interconnectedness with American identity."
Red River,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,7.0,2020-8-14,"Although there's a touch of excitement at the start, the film seems to exist primarily as a history lesson rather than a piece of adventurous entertainment."
Red River,Matthew Sorrento,Film International,10.0,2014-9-20,"Wayne is an offbeat presence in River. His longish hair and loose gait - the latter usually indicating a relaxed sense of power - now imply a man out of his place, and a kind of restlessness."
Red River,Christopher Long,Movie Metropolis,8.0,2014-8-3,"Just when loyalty seems to be an entirely perverse and oppressive force in this world of might makes right, the film (shows) there are limits decent men won't cross."
Red River,James Kendrick,Q Network Film Desk,8.75,2014-6-9,"inaugurated the second, more intriguing half of John Wayne's career, enabling him to be cast in roles that were more than just macho posturing and gruff heroism"
Red River,John Beifuss,"Commercial Appeal (Memphis, TN)",10.0,2014-6-6,"It was Hawks' genius to recognize a kinship between his leads, and to understand that the 'naturalism' of the Wayne persona was as deep and complex as the more intellectualized approach of the neurotic young New York stage actor, Clift."
Red River,Keith Phipps,The Dissolve,10.0,2014-6-2,"Hawks directs the film with his typical assurance and seeming lack of fuss, letting scenes play out in long takes, and framing the action against vistas that often dwarf the actors."

Key Largo,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-22,"Loosely based on Maxwell Anderson’s 1939 play, “Key Largo” took the form of a brilliant crime drama anchored by a great cast and superb performances."
Key Largo,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,9.0,2020-8-13,"The real stars of the film are mind games and manipulation, sharply brought to life by the restrained verbal feuding between Bogart and Robinson."

Key Largo,Nathanael Hood,The Retro Set,8.0,2018-12-29,It's pure irony that perhaps the objective best Bogart and Bacall film has their least satisfying onscreen relationship.
Key Largo,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,7.5,2018-12-21,"This is surprisingly staid for a Huston film. Still, the top-notch cast punches it across, and the swirling storm raging outside the hotel provides an interesting backdrop."
Key Largo,PJ Nabarro,Patrick Nabarro,6.0,2018-12-16,A classy little '40s chamber piece that is competently handled by writer-director John Huston and supremely well acted by its starry cast.
Key Largo,Josh Larsen,LarsenOnFilm,7.5,2012-7-27,"First seen soaking in a tub while chomping on a cigar, Robinson arises from the water to put a stranglehold on the film."
Key Largo,Wesley Lovell,Cinema Sight,8.75,2011-8-15,"Trapped in a country estate by an impending storm, a mobster attempts to lay low before escaping from the police, but takes a risky gambit holding Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall hostage."

To Have and Have Not,Nathanael Hood,The Retro Set,6.0,2018-12-29,The effortless chemistry between Bogart and Bacall help distract from the fact that To Have and Have Not has little more going for it.
To Have and Have Not,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,8.75,2018-12-21,"The dialogue crackles (including the legendary ""whistle / blow"" line), Bacall sizzles, and Bogart captivates."

Bringing Up Baby,Richard Schickel,Video Review,10.0,2023-7-25,The dialogue sparkles and the acting shines as the big cat escapes and mishap follows mishap in swift succession.
Bringing Up Baby,Angie Errigo,Empire Magazine,10.0,2023-7-25,"Countless films have imitated Bringing Up Baby, most famously Peter Bogdanovich's homage What's Up, Doc?, but it is futile to look for its equal."
Bringing Up Baby,Sara Michelle Fetters,MovieFreak.com,10.0,2023-3-30,"If you catch me on the right day and ask what I think the best comedy of all time is, it’s very likely I’ll say it’s 1938’s screwball classic Bringing Up Baby."
Bride of Frankenstein,David Reddish,Queerty,10.0,2022-3-20,"Chock full of stunning black and white photography, groundbreaking make-up and special effects, and mad dark comedy, classic horror doesnt get much better than Bride of Frankenstein. It doesnt get much gayer, either."

Bride of Frankenstein,Film4 Staff,Film4,10.0,2007-9-24,"A must for anyone with even a passing interest in horror, this not only confirms Karloff as a master of the genre, but also shows, more than any of Whale's subsequent films, the influence of his vision."
Bride of Frankenstein,Simon Braund,Empire Magazine,10.0,2007-9-24,"Whale's erudite genius brings it all together. He sculpts every nuance of self-parody, social satire, horror, humour, wit and whimsy into a dazzling whole, keeping every one of his fantastical plates spinning until the tragic, inevitable finale."

Duck Soup,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,10.0,2022-8-20,"There’s no dense or intricate narrative in the film. It’s simply a basic story that allows Groucho, Harpo, and Chico to showcase their comedic chaos."
Duck Soup,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-2-12,"Duck Soup might be the only Marx Brothers film that feels completely in tune with their brand of humor, which, then and now, is downright radical."
Duck Soup,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,9.0,2020-7-26,"Babbling absurdity is the main ingredient and chaos is the result, with random jokes, skits, and sketches composing the bulk of the story."
Duck Soup,Peter Canavese,Groucho Reviews,10.0,2016-10-18,"For all its wild comic abandon, Duck Soup has darker implications than the usual Marx Brothers comedy and, as such, feels the most relevant and sharp in its satire. [Blu-ray]"
Duck Soup,Kate Muir,Times (UK),8.0,2015-1-16,"It turns out that the sharp-tongued humour of Groucho Marx is ageless, the slapstick timely and the subject matter still pertinent: loony dictatorship, religion, pointless warfare."
Duck Soup,Tom Hutchinson,Radio Times,10.0,2015-1-16,The funniest of the Marx Brothers pictures ...
Duck Soup,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,10.0,2015-1-15,The sheer silliness is inspired ...
Duck Soup,David Jenkins,Little White Lies,6.0,2015-1-15,Questioning the canonical standing of a titan such as Duck Soup seems like an exercise in questioning the tastes of those who like it rather than the upbraiding the comedy mechanics of the film itself.
Duck Soup,Emma Simmonds,The List,10.0,2015-1-15,A comedy classic that boasts some of Groucho's prickliest zingers and the pinnacle of Harpo's mirthful mischief.

Roma,Denise Pieniazek,Metacultura (AR),8.0,2023-12-28,"...This is no coincidence since Roma represents the portrait of a canonical family model that also collapses, which is also consistent with the prominence of an earthquake during one of the most significant scenes of the feature film."
Roma,Serena Seghedoni,Loud and Clear Reviews,10.0,2023-11-4,"that is Cuarón’s true magic: when the film is over, although we don’t know exactly how and when it happened, a little part of his Mexico somehow belongs to us too."
Roma,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-25,It truly is a movie of detail with each gorgeous black-and-white shot framed like a richly detailed memory begging to be examined.
Roma,M.N. Miller,Ready Steady Cut,6.0,2022-8-17,"Cuaron is a master filmmaker who creates true hyperrealism with Roma, a front seat to everyday life. It’s admirable in its approach and beautifully photographed, but there is an emotional disconnect that can’t be shaken."
Roma,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-3-4,"Roma is the sort of film described as life-affirming without irony or pretense, as it reminds us of the potential for love, frailty, and unbreakable bonds between people."
Roma,Taylor Baker,Drink in the Movies,9.8,2021-9-3,"A staggering swirl of life, a film that destroys and uplifts simultaneously."
Roma,Carolyn Hinds,But Why Tho? A Geek Community,8.0,2021-7-30,"In her first feature film debut, Aparicio gave a performance that though quiet in execution, was powerful."
Roma,Nicolás Delgadillo,Discussing Film,9.0,2021-6-25,"Without a doubt the most essential film of Cuarón's career, and obviously, his most personal"
Roma,Sophie Charara,NME (New Musical Express),10.0,2021-4-28,A stunning piece of personal cinema.
Deadpool 2,Don Shanahan,Every Movie Has a Lesson,8.0,2024-4-7,"The flames are fattened, the bloodshed is bolstered, and the hail of hot lead is heightened as all of these wild elements compose a parade of profanity and dirty delights."
Deadpool 2,Joseph Garcia,Dynamic Duel Podcast,7.0,2023-2-16,"Overall, not as good as the first film. While the sequel is bigger and funnier, the story is more uneven. However, it does succeed in places where the previous one failed... it has [more] gravitas."
Deadpool 2,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,7.5,2022-3-14,"Although less cohesive and more meandering than the first, it's an entertaining sequel that pushes the franchise forward."
Deadpool 2,Nicholas Oon,Maximum Hype (YouTube),8.0,2021-8-14,"There's a lot of swearing, a lot of dirty jokes, a lot of violence with limbs and body parts getting cut off left and right. Basically, the first Deadpool, just with double the fun."
Deadpool 2,Nicolás Delgadillo,Discussing Film,6.0,2021-6-24,"Isn't as great as its predecessor was, but it sticks to its guns with enough panache to keep it afloat."
Deadpool 2,Nick Reilly,NME (New Musical Express),8.0,2021-4-29,"A third installment, you sense, makes perfect sense."
Deadpool 2,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,7.0,2020-12-5,"It's all consistently funny, even if it's difficult to praise it for its originality."
Deadpool 2,Paul McGuire Grimes,"KSTP-TV (St. Paul, MN)",7.0,2020-11-4,"Like many sequels, it doesn't feel as fresh and original as the first only because we are now used to the character and what to expect. On the flip side, it's bolder, bigger, and definitely pushes the boundaries."
Deadpool 2,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,6.25,2020-9-5,A vastly more derivative film.
Deadpool 2,Jason Fraley,"WTOP (Washington, D.C.)",6.25,2020-8-29,"In the first film, Deadpool scoffed and said, ""That sounds like a f***ing franchise."" Now, by becoming a franchise itself, Deadpool just sold out."
Deadpool 2,Matt Cipolla,Film Monthly,4.0,2020-7-24,"I couldn't overlook the smugness that seemed to come from a certain corner of Reddit, and I couldn't give myself over to the anarchy because the anarchy felt all too calculated."
Deadpool 2,Alex Hudson,Exclaim!,8.0,2020-7-18,"Rather than skewering the superhero genre, it largely plays by the rules, and the result is a gripping action flick."
Deadpool 2,Yasser Medina,Cinefilia,7.0,2020-6-27,"It maintains an adequate, agile rhythm, in which comedy and action are balanced to present, sometimes, ephemeral scenes that seek to portray a more personal chronicle of Deadpool, but that, equally, end up being satirized. [Full review in Spanish]"
Get Out,Benjamín Harguindey,EscribiendoCine,7.0,2023-6-21,Get Out achieves something that few films of its ilk do: build a scary story with human pathologies instead of ghosts and monsters... [Full review in Spanish]
Get Out,Fico Cangiano,CineXpress Podcast,8.0,2023-1-8,"One of the most original and refreshing films to hit the cinema in years. Jordan Peele's feature debut works as a smart dark comedy, satire and psychological thriller, touching on very relevant issues today. [Full review in Spanish]"
Get Out,Norman Gidney,HorrorBuzz,8.0,2022-12-12,Get Out is a razor-sharp horror movie with a wicked sense of humor and an adroit perspective.
Get Out,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,5.0,2022-8-21,"Peele clearly aims to make a movie that can be several different things at once, but I’m not sure any of the film’s multiple identities are all that strong."
Get Out,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,8.75,2022-4-5,Get Out is essential viewing for the socially conscious horror fan.
Get Out,Drew Dietsch,FANDOM,10.0,2021-12-29,Get Out is horror filmmaking at its absolute finest.
Get Out,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,8.75,2021-11-22,"Get Out is perhaps the best terror tale since the mid-2000s served up The Descent and Pan's Labyrinth, two masterworks that, like this one, have much more on tap than just creeping out audiences."
Get Out,Yasmin Omar,Harper's Bazaar,10.0,2021-6-25,Its sucker punch to the status quo has ensured it's impossible to forget.
Get Out,Michael J. Casey,Michael J. Cinema,8.0,2021-5-29,"Well told, impressively rendered, and creepy as all hell."
Get Out,Olly Richards,NME (New Musical Express),8.0,2021-4-28,"A smart, creepy, cliché-destroying horror."
Get Out,Richard Crouse,Richard Crouse,8.0,2021-3-4,"Get Out is a horror film but like all great genre films it isn't just that. It could more rightly be called a social thriller, a film that looks at everyday ills - in this case racial tension - through the lens of a genre movie."
Get Out,Tony Black,Cultural Conversation,10.0,2021-2-14,"A tense, creeping drama that gets under your skin, makes you laugh and then explodes outward in the most satisfying, pulpy of ways. Get Out is all of those things."
Get Out,Leo Brady,AMovieGuy.com,8.75,2021-2-7,"Get Out is a smart, quite funny, and startling picture, you just have to see it."
Get Out,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,7.0,2020-12-5,"Kaluuya is exceptionally grounded (continuously tossing around genuinely inquisitive expressions), making the eerie situations more realistic and more humorous."
What We Do in the Shadows,Patrick Cavanaugh,The Wolfman Cometh,10.0,2023-9-20,"Manages not only to be hilarious in its own right, but also offers plenty of gags that will resonate even more strongly with horror fans."
What We Do in the Shadows,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-21,"Rarely does the movie miss a beat, and its cleverness shows itself in a host of ways. It's subtly subversive, subtly satirical, and openly absurd."
What We Do in the Shadows,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,8.75,2022-6-21,"What We Do in the Shadows walks—or hovers over—a darker edge, and that makes it funnier and aimed less toward mainstream audiences and more toward cult crowds."
What We Do in the Shadows,Josh Parham,Next Best Picture,7.0,2022-5-27,"It may not be the absolute best of what this mashup of genres can provide, but it is still a worthy entry that will leave you smiling all the way to the end."
What We Do in the Shadows,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,8.75,2021-9-18,"A Christopher Guest-styled mockumentary about vampires sounds only a little less obvious and opportunistic than a ""found-footage"" feature about vampires, yet Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi have managed to create a savvy satire that works beautifully."
What We Do in the Shadows,Richard Crouse,Richard Crouse,8.0,2021-2-2,"Just when you thought mockumentary and vampire movies had played themselves out along comes What We Do in the Shadows, a vampire mockumentary that feels fresh and funny."
What We Do in the Shadows,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,7.0,2020-12-4,"The execution could use some refining, but the comedy elements are surely sound."
What We Do in the Shadows,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,8.75,2020-9-27,It is a perfectly good piffle of a film.
What We Do in the Shadows,Leigh Paatsch,Herald Sun (Australia),7.0,2020-4-28,Despite the simple structure - and a crack at every obvious vampire gag in the book - the film remains highly amusing from beginning to end.
What We Do in the Shadows,Katie Smith-Wong,Flick Feast,9.0,2019-11-19,"Overall, What We Do In The Shadows not only sets the standard for a great vampire comedy, but also as a great comedy for 2014."
What We Do in the Shadows,Joey Keogh,Wicked Horror,8.0,2019-9-25,What We Do In The Shadows is a remarkably assured debut.
The Fault in Our Stars,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,7.0,2022-8-20,It actually presents us with situations and a relationship that feels genuine yet uncertain because of the dark cloud hanging over it.
The Fault in Our Stars,Richard Crouse,Richard Crouse,7.0,2021-2-1,My biggest complaint about the whole experience was being splashed by the tears of my fellow moviegoers. Bring a towel.
The Fault in Our Stars,Leigh Paatsch,Herald Sun (Australia),8.0,2020-11-17,The winning combo of the shamelessly melodramatic and the slyly mischievous that powers the movie owes much to yet another pitch-perfect lead performance from Woodley.
The Fault in Our Stars,James Croot,Stuff.co.nz,5.0,2020-11-10,"Sadly, in Hollywood's hands all the things that made John Green's taut, touching and terrific 2012 novel transcend generation gaps have been jettisoned in favour of a hyperglycaemic tale of two star-crossed (cancer-riddled) teens."
The Fault in Our Stars,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,8.75,2020-9-7,"In other words, this is real. If anyone tells you differently, they haven't a clue."
The Fault in Our Stars,Nicholas Bell,IONCINEMA.com,5.0,2019-8-30,"In a laudable attempt to seem heartfelt without blatant manipulation, the film generally succeeds, thanks especially to a winning performance from Shailene Woodley."
The Fault in Our Stars,Karl Delossantos,Smash Cut Reviews,9.4,2019-8-8,"It's charming, well-written, superbly acted."
The Fault in Our Stars,Patrick Taylor,One Room With A View,8.0,2019-6-14,"Heartfelt, sincere and altogether rather wonderful, The Fault in Our Stars will enchant audiences and leave behind very few dry eyes in its wake."
The Fault in Our Stars,Bernard Boo,Way Too Indie,8.0,2019-3-28,"Woodley and Elgort are gifted in that they exude intelligence, thoughtfulness, and savvy, making smart dialogue sound smart, the corniest lines sound terribly romantic and natural."
The Fault in Our Stars,Adam Lowes,CineVue,8.0,2019-3-26,"Under the assured direction of Josh Boone, the film earns its emotions without grand manipulative gestures, and finds its heart through the fantastic cast and an effortless and appealing intimacy between the characters."
The Fault in Our Stars,Jennifer Heaton,Alternative Lens,8.5,2018-11-1,"It will certainly be a tearjerker for some, but the film's final triumphant message means that you shouldn't be too depressed when you leave the theatre."
The Fault in Our Stars,Pamela Powell,"Daily Journal (Kankakee, IL)",3.75,2018-8-21,The two-hour and five-minute running time of continuous sadness and unending pearls of wisdom made this viewer disconnect from the characters.
Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,8.0,2022-8-24,"It’s a story with a lot to say about the value of true friendship, and it’s not ashamed to tackle a difficult subject in its own personal way. I kinda like that boldness."
Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,Victoria Luxford,City AM,8.0,2022-2-18,"Where so many American indie flicks would overdo it on the kooky characters and wink-wink one-liners, this (film) knows when to hold back. Like Greg himself, Me and Earl is gentle, self-effacing and a good deal smarter than it lets on."
Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,6.0,2020-12-4,"The further the picture progresses, the more it fizzles and flounders."
Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,10.0,2020-9-16,One of the year's best films.
Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,Leslie Combemale,Cinema Siren (YouTube),10.0,2019-8-5,"The spectacularly poignant ending, complete with growth, insight, and truth, will rip you apart and just as rebuild you."
Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,Rachel Brook,One Room With A View,8.0,2019-5-4,"Mann and Cooke's performances are so open and natural that the screenplay's intelligent interrogation of lofty themes - including death, fear, and intergenerational relationships - never feels preachy or condescending."
Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,Bernard Boo,Way Too Indie,7.0,2019-3-13,"What's captured here so well is the solipsism and confusion of being an adolescent who's forced to deal with death before you're ready to, an aspect of life so many films have trouble representing on-screen."
Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,Jennifer Heaton,Alternative Lens,10.0,2018-11-1,"Despite being cobbled together from so many familiar pieces, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl feels wholly unique and is one of the best movies of the year."
Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,Deirdre Crimmins,Cinematic Essential,5.0,2018-8-30,"Character issues aside, the film tries far too hard to add eccentric touches to the visual language."
Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,Camilla Long,Sunday Times (UK),2.0,2018-4-23,"Greg spoke like a self-congratulatory 30-year-old novelist. At the start, he says: ""I made a film so bad, it nearly killed someone."" I didn't realise that someone would be me."
Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,Robert Kojder,Flickering Myth,8.0,2017-12-3,Bernthal's history teacher gives a monologue about continuing to learn about loved ones long after they're gone that is beautifully written and delivered.
Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,Matthew Bond,The Mail on Sunday (UK),6.0,2017-10-30,"It doesn't get off to the strongest start but improves rapidly, thanks largely to the low-key but nicely winning performances delivered by Thomas Mann and R J Cyler as teenage buddies and amateur film-makers Greg and Earl."
The Broken Circle Breakdown,Leo Brady,AMovieGuy.com,7.5,2021-1-31,The Broken Circle Breakdown never pulls punches when it comes to telling the complex realities of life that exist in the films story.
The Broken Circle Breakdown,Leigh Paatsch,Herald Sun (Australia),7.0,2020-5-8,"Unrelentingly bleak, but grittily beautiful stuff. Wonderful live music sequences sweeten an otherwise uncompromising deal."
The Broken Circle Breakdown,C.J. Prince,Way Too Indie,5.0,2019-6-22,"As for everything else, The Broken Circle Breakdown is a well-made but ultimately ineffective film."
The Broken Circle Breakdown,Sophia Satchell Baeza,CineVue,8.0,2019-3-5,"Van Groeningen's masterful use of music guides the emotional direction of a scene in a way that rarely feels exploitative. Where the film scores highest, however, is with the central performances of its two leads."
The Broken Circle Breakdown,Rania Richardson,The Villager,7.5,2018-12-6,THE BROKEN CIRCLE BREAKDOWN is a heart-wrenching tale and the cinematic equivalent of a twangy country song.
The Broken Circle Breakdown,Austin Trunick,Under the Radar,7.5,2014-8-18,"More so than its music, Broken Circle's greatest merit are the compelling performances Van Groeningen cultivates from both his leads."
The Broken Circle Breakdown,David Stratton,The Australian,6.0,2014-5-19,"It's a film about a couple whose tumultuous relationship is severely challenged, and the performances are excellent."
The Broken Circle Breakdown,Paul Byrnes,Sydney Morning Herald,9.0,2014-5-19,"Where the Coen brothers gently mocked th[e] music in O Brother Where art Thou?, this plucky little Belgian film reconnects that music to the sorrows that produced it. Just brilliant."
The Broken Circle Breakdown,Jim Schembri,3AW,6.0,2014-5-16,"There are plenty of touching, powerful moments in director Felix Van Groeningen's child-with-cancer drama...though [it's] somewhat laboured. The 2012 French film Declaration of War dealt with a similar topic in more lyrical, more affecting manner."
The Broken Circle Breakdown,Damien Straker,Impulse Gamer,5.0,2014-5-13,In spite of the bleak premise the film isn't an emotional force.
Rockstar,Nikhat Kazmi,The Times of India,8.0,2020-2-28,"The fact that this romance unfolds on screen in the form of an explosive musical, capturing JJ's transmutation into Jordan, the edgy artist, makes the film an absolutely engaging affair."
Rockstar,Shubhra Gupta,The Indian Express,4.0,2019-3-29,Rockstar disappoints; Ranbir [Kapoor] doesn't.
Rockstar,Anil Sinanan,Time Out,6.0,2017-10-24,It is redeemed by an accomplished performance from the talented handsome male-lead and by songs which rock.
Rockstar,Manish Gajjar,Birmingham Mail,6.0,2011-11-25,Clever editing renders the disjointed narrative through flashbacks to reflect the hero's chaotic upheavals.
Rockstar,Priya Joshi,Digital Spy,8.0,2011-11-16,"A simple story, beautifully enacted, perfectly crafted, there is not much to fault in this film. Exemplary cinema by any standards."
Nebraska,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-24,There are an assortment of memorable faces which add so much character and detail to the setting and the story itself.
Nebraska,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,7.5,2022-8-19,"However thoughtful its existential investigation may be, Payne’s film also delivers plenty of quiet laughs at the expense of its characters."
Nebraska,Zoë Rose Bryant,Next Best Picture,9.0,2022-7-14,"If one looks past Nebraska's supposedly ""plain"" packaging, they'll find a compelling character-driven crusade dripping with depth that is delicately delivered through both Bob Morgan's script & two powerful lead performances from Will Forte & Bruce Dern."
Nebraska,Ian Kane,Epoch Times,8.0,2022-5-21,“Nebraska” is easy on the eyes and soul. It’s a redemptive and often humorous tale that shows it’s never too late to heal a fractured family.
Nebraska,Mark Jackson,Epoch Times,4.0,2022-4-5,"""Nebraska"" is about the non-Hero's Journey; life lived terminally inside the village compound, with no aspirations to anything other than a bit of comfort. It's possible to make an exciting movie about unexciting lives, but Nebraska is not that movie."
Nebraska,Richard Crouse,Richard Crouse,9.0,2021-2-1,A plain spoken but lyrical black-and-white film about a man grasping at a last chance for a legacy.
Nebraska,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,7.0,2020-12-3,Dern delivers a fine performance (a considerable distance away from ruthlessly killing John Wayne).
Nebraska,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,8.75,2020-9-18,Alexander Payne has crafted a film that doesn't feel like a film.
Nebraska,David Harris,Spectrum Culture,8.0,2019-11-21,"Despite its shortcomings, Nebraska offers much to grant it a strong recommendation, mainly for Payne's largely mature and unflinching look at the dusty underside of the American Dream."
Nebraska,Katie Smith-Wong,Flick Feast,8.0,2019-11-21,"The plot of this is really simple yet believable, making it easy to care about the situation - all of which is made better by the subtle performances of its cast."
Nebraska,Christopher Preston,One Room With A View,6.0,2019-6-8,"It droops in the middle and veers off into sticky sentimentality by its third act, but Nebraska is still able to retain a solid charm."
Nebraska,Alexa Dalby,Dog and Wolf,10.0,2019-6-7,Nebraska is a bleak view of contemporary America but also a loving one.
Nebraska,Daniel Green,CineVue,8.0,2019-3-6,"A deeply personal, emotionally resonant and -- let's not forget -- richly entertaining road movie with several award-worthy performances."
Nebraska,Di Golding,Dear Cast and Crew,8.0,2018-12-11,"No splashy, sentimental performances. No outrageous plot twists. No CGI. Just regular folks reckoning with their circumstances, quietly, with dignity, and suffused with director Alexander Payne's signature dry wit."
Detachment,Sonia Zadurian,CineVue,6.0,2019-1-26,"Detachment clearly has high aspirations, but unfortunately its jumbled narration means that it falls just shy of the mark."
Detachment,PJ Nabarro,Patrick Nabarro,6.0,2019-1-8,"Tony Kaye's ragged, expressionistic aesthetic may have its detractors but it intuitively suits the wrought scenario of Detachment."
Detachment,Ashley Norris,HeyUGuys,9.0,2013-2-5,It's a film so well paced with a message so relevant that it deserves an audience bigger than what it got and it deserves more of an emotional impact than will resonant throughout.
Detachment,Jeff Beck,We Got This Covered,5.0,2013-1-22,"While Adrien Brody gives it his all in his performance, the film suffers greatly from an attempt to equalize its multiple plotlines."
Detachment,Graham Young,Birmingham Post,8.0,2012-8-15,Detachment is the sort of film-of-the-week that ought to appeal to anyone who loves movies in the purest sense.
Detachment,Donald Clarke,Irish Times,6.0,2012-7-15,Detachment has such original energy and is so infused with righteous anger that it proves hard to dismiss.
Detachment,Stella Papamichael,Radio Times,6.0,2012-7-13,"Admittedly, the film is heavy-handed in places, but it still makes you sit up and take notice."
Detachment,Tim Robey,Daily Telegraph (UK),2.0,2012-7-13,"Grappling with the dilapidation of America's school system is fair enough, but the movie is painfully undone by its pretentious poetry of despair."
Detachment,Derek Malcolm,London Evening Standard,6.0,2012-7-13,"If Detachment is only partially successful, it is still more watchable than most school sagas."
Detachment,Allan Hunter,Daily Express (UK),8.0,2012-7-13,It is pretentious and overbearing at times but passionate.
Detachment,Grant Rollings,The Sun (UK),6.0,2012-7-12,"It is a touch more subtle than X, carrying off the tough trick of being both amusing and depressing."
Detachment,Andrew Pulver,Guardian,6.0,2012-7-12,"It's watchable enough, but the bludgeoning screenplay seems undercooked compared to the high-grade actors on show."
Detachment,Nigel Andrews,Financial Times,6.0,2012-7-12,Like the recent Margaret it rages against the dying of the light in a country where too many people think the lights are still on.
Detachment,Matt Bochenski,Little White Lies,4.0,2012-7-12,"It's a vaguely elegant brute of a film, but a long way from Kaye's best."
Detachment,Matthew Turner,ViewLondon,6.0,2012-7-11,"Stylishly directed and sharply written, this is an engaging, if ultimately depressing drama with strong performances from a superb ensemble cast."
Midnight in Paris,Wesley Lovell,Cinema Sight,8.75,2023-10-10,"If the viewer is able to set aside their personal distaste for the creator, the film is a wonderful sit. If they cannot, then it steadily reminds them of the personality Allen curated for decades and that might just be a bridge too far."
Midnight in Paris,Ezequiel Obregón,EscribiendoCine,8.0,2023-6-27,"An absolute ghost comedy, the story is reminiscent of Dickens' Christmas Carol. [Full review in Spanish]"
Midnight in Paris,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2023-6-7,"A blithe, lovable comedy about those greener pastures of yesteryear when times were simpler and seemingly carefree, at least in our imagination."
Midnight in Paris,Cody Dericks,Next Best Picture,6.0,2023-5-4,The film is content to let a handful of underwhelming period costumes and sparsely adorned sets suffice to transport viewers to a world where the main character can’t stop ogling.
Midnight in Paris,Michael Clark,Epoch Times,9.0,2022-12-4,"In the 11 years since “Midnight” was released, Allen has made eight more features and, sadly, all but one of them—the brilliant “Blue Jasmine,” a clever reworking of “A Streetcar Named Desire” are out-and-out stinkers. The man has simply run out of ideas."
Midnight in Paris,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,10.0,2022-8-24,"This is certainly a love letter to Paris, but it’s also a lesson on living in the present. Allen reminds us that the golden age so many long for isn’t that different from where we are now."
Midnight in Paris,Yasser Medina,Cinefilia,7.0,2020-6-24,Allen's magic immerses us in nostalgia and romantic illusion during two hours of pure entertainment. [Full review in Spanish]

Midnight in Paris,Kelly Jane Torrance,Washington Examiner,8.0,2019-1-8,"It's funny, warm, even enchanting."
Midnight in Paris,Edward Frost,CineVue,8.0,2018-12-1,"A gear shift for a director whose weathered career is jolted back to life, matching bouncy dialogue and a whimsically comical plot with the glossy climes of the sepia toned city of love."
The Lego Movie,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-23,"Great voice acting, sharp writing, and a wonderful story all the way down to its core."
The Lego Movie,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,7.5,2022-8-18,"In the end, the costs (both monetary and social) of The LEGO Movie are less than desirable, but it works on multiple levels as the best animated films often do, and provides a number of distinctive visual touches to keep the viewer involved and laughing."
The Lego Movie,Dan Bayer,Next Best Picture,8.0,2022-5-13,"It’s the best possible ad for Legos that the company could have ever hoped for, and it achieves that by embedding in its very concept the kind of play that has kept both kids and adults playing with Legos for years."
The Lego Movie,Danielle Solzman,Solzy at the Movies,9.0,2022-3-9,The LEGO Movie is a beautifully animated film that remains one of the best films of 2014.

The Lego Movie,Rachel Wagner,rachelsreviews.net,9.0,2019-2-21,I was completely surprised by this movie.
Star Trek Into Darkness,Patrick Cavanaugh,The Wolfman Cometh,8.0,2023-9-20,"It might not hold a candle to the best the franchise has to offer, though it serves as a worthy follow-up to the universe introduced in 2009, thanks to an entirely charming cast and ambitious visual effects."

Flipped,Frederica Mathewes-Green,Christianity Today,5.0,2010-9-24,"Rob Reiner seems to be aiming for a boomer audience, but it's a relentless exercise in nostalgia -- clothes, hair styles, cars, and doo-wop soundtrack -- that feels manipulative."

Control,Pablo Villaça,Cinema em Cena,8.0,2008-5-26,Um filme repleto de planos magnificamente compostos e que se tornam ainda mais impactantes graças à impecável fotografia em preto-e-branco de Martin Ruhe.
Tangled,Michael Clark,Epoch Times,9.0,2024-1-10,"Bolstered by an array of snappy original songs composed by Alan Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater in tandem with a superbly droll screenplay by Dan Fogelman, “Tangled” is eminently captivating, impossible to resist and, for the easily prone, tear-jerking."
Tangled,Don Shanahan,Every Movie Has a Lesson,8.0,2023-9-4,"It might not be Pixar, but the colors, textures, and details modeled after French Rococo oil-and-canvas paintings are amazing."
Tangled,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,6.25,2023-8-3,"It’s all very bright and colorful, no doubt accentuated beyond the norm for the sake of 3D’s downfall dimming effect. Still, there’s no sense of wonder about the production."
Tangled,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,8.0,2020-11-30,"At its finest moments, this production emanates the nostalgic feel of classic 2-D animated Disney films."
Tangled,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,8.75,2020-9-25,Disney comes closer to nailing the mix of entertainment and emotional resonance that has become a trademark of the Pixar films.
Tangled,Mattie Lucas,"The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)",7.5,2019-6-7,"A glorious throwback, a toe-tapping, swoon-worthy fairy tale extravaganza the likes of which we haven't seen in a long time."
Tangled,Johnny Gayzmonic,Fanboys of the Universe,8.0,2018-11-4,"A welcome reminder of some of Disney's best works. The animation is exquisite, the script fantastic, and the leads all perform well."
Tangled,Margot Harrison,Seven Days (VT),7.0,2014-12-8,"A heroine who finds love and freedom after she loses acres of blond Barbie hair -- these days, that's a radical fable."
Tangled,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,4.0,2014-12-8,"Rapunzel gets a very ordinary updating in this Disney picture, raiding duller moments from the Shrek movies for ideas, and sporting a laboured selection of Broadway-style showtunes."

Brokeback Mountain,Steven Lindsey,Texas Triangle/TXT,10.0,2023-5-8,"Director Ang Lee, working from an adaptation of a short story from Annie Proulx, has created an epic motion picture about the power of love and the tragedy of separation. The chemistry between the stars is intense and tender."

Brokeback Mountain,Mattie Lucas,"The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)",10.0,2019-6-5,"Lee has crafted a film that flouts stereotypes and becomes one of the most sincere, most deeply felt love stories in years."
Brokeback Mountain,Namrata Joshi,Outlook,7.5,2019-1-10,"What is remarkable about the film is how it doesn't politicise the homosexuality theme, transcends it to become the story of two people in doomed love. The two lead characters are wonderfully delineated."
Brokeback Mountain,Matthew Pejkovic,Matt's Movie Reviews,8.0,2010-7-6,"A romantic western with a twist, Brokeback Mountain is a haunting and well acted exploration of a forbidden and secretive love affair between two cowboys."
The Machinist,Film4 Staff,Film4,6.0,2011-10-24,"If Nine Inch Nails, Swans and Ministry ever loomed large in the landscape of your imagination, Anderson's gloomy aesthetic may exert a sour but lingering pull."

The Machinist,Ian Nathan,Empire Magazine,6.0,2006-4-1,"A few scenes into the gloom and you'll have a good idea what is generally up, if not the specifics, making the journey toward the eventual, inevitable twist fairly one-dimensional."

The Machinist,Don R. Lewis,Film Threat,8.0,2005-12-6,Kosar has ... constructed an exercise in existentialism that is so literal it's a true feat that he was able to reign it all back in for the somewhat tidy ending of this film.

Ray,Alex Maidy,JoBlo's Movie Network,6.0,2019-8-19,"RAY suffers from having not enough story to warrant a feature film and too much talent wasted on caricatures of historical figures. RAY, like last year's BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY, is too focused on homage rather than telling a convincing and stirring story."
Ray,Paul Dale,The List,8.0,2019-4-23,"Jamie Foxx as Charles proves again that he may just be one of the most interesting actors of his generation. A subtle mix of impression, pathos and rare presence, Foxx holds your focus even when the film begins to prevaricate."
Ray,R.L. Shaffer,IGN DVD,8.0,2011-2-5,A powerhouse performance piece for Jamie Foxx and a rock solid biopic.

Lost in Translation,Victor Pineyro,Seventh Art Studio,7.0,2022-4-7,"Life stops being terrifying when we open the doors to the unknown. Even for a short amount of time. Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"" is written beautifully. Full review in Spanish"
Lost in Translation,David Gonzalez,The Cinematic Reel,10.0,2022-2-18,"Lost in Translation respectfully tackles the subject of companionship and relationships while still providing laughs. Its a film that I regretfully waited too long to view, but grateful to have found this gem."
Lost in Translation,Tom Meek,Cambridge Day,10.0,2020-10-9,"Murray, playing an extension of himself, fills the role with ease, and Johansson is right in step with him."
Lost in Translation,Kelechi Ehenulo,Screen Queens,8.0,2020-7-16,What Coppola presents is something akin to a mindfulness session - the art of being present in the moment.
Lost in Translation,Tim Brayton,Antagony & Ecstasy,8.0,2013-7-29,Depicts a very specific mental state too shaded and delicate for most movies to feel comfortable approaching it.
Lost in Translation,Nell Minow,Common Sense Media,10.0,2010-12-25,Excellent but mature film about finding a connection.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,6.25,2021-12-13,"...a woefully uneven installment that feels, for the most part, as though it should be a good hour shorter..."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,6.0,2020-9-29,It's increasingly evident that seven books and as many as eight theatrical adaptations fuel the need for too much filler subplots or nonessential side characters.
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Guillem Martinez Oya,Cinematismo,8.0,2019-7-11,Good film directed for a teenage audience in which not only is magic taught but also how stereotypes affect it while the film itself recreates some British stereotypes. [Review in Spanish]
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Mattie Lucas,"The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)",7.5,2019-6-5,"For the first time, the stakes of this battle of good and evil become painfully evident."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Sukhdev Sandhu,Daily Telegraph (UK),8.0,2014-12-8,Where Newell really scores is in taking a leaf out of Peter Jackson's book and cranking up the fear factor.
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,6.0,2014-12-8,"For those like me who are outside but sympathetic to the faith, it looks like another handsomely made, good-natured and high-spirited family movie, which is dramatically stymied through being locked within school grounds."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Jim Schembri,The Age (Australia),3.0,2014-12-8,"Goblet is really just a glorified, 157-minute teaser trailer, an empty epic of proportions that truly stagger."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Jay Stone,Canada.com,7.0,2014-12-8,"The adolescent subplot is treated sweetly by Newell. The awkward dances and dating faux pas at the school ball feel like additions from some other, less mythic series, and form a welcome respite from the intense magic-making of the rest of the film."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Michael Kleinschrodt,Times-Picayune,10.0,2014-12-8,"Much of the credit goes to Radcliffe and his co-stars, who have become better actors with each film. They have become increasingly adept at conveying great emotion as each film demands more of them."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Matt Soergel,Florida Times-Union,8.75,2014-12-8,The acting is stronger than ever in this fourth installment.
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Dennis King,Tulsa World,8.75,2014-12-8,"By demonstrating to us how Harry and his friends are budding and changing and struggling, the film demonstrates the progressive richness of Rowling's storytelling skills and oddly haunting allure of her writing."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Daniel Saney,Digital Spy,10.0,2014-12-8,"All in all, Goblet of Fire is certainly the best Potter yet, with most of the cast doing their roles justice, some great direction and Steven Kloves' screenplay makes the core of Rowling's novel into a fast-paced but easily-comprehensible enjoyable movie."
Man on Fire,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,5.0,2022-8-24,At almost two-and-a-half hours the film really needs more meat on its bones.
Man on Fire,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,5.0,2020-9-15,This is a merely average film that had much more potential.

Man on Fire,Anthony Quinn,Independent (UK),2.0,2005-12-6,"If it's just Scott's way of saying, ""Get a load of this, Quentin"", the speed of response (12 years since Reservoir Dogs) leaves something to be desired."
Man on Fire,Mark R. Leeper,rec.arts.movies.reviews,4.0,2005-3-30,"Visually the film is nice, but the images are in service to a violent and ugly film."

In America,Nick Rogers,Midwest Film Journal,10.0,2010-9-24,"""In America"" serves as a peaceful reminder of the simplicity and clarity with which kids can stare down death and help adults come to a place of comfort - earning its cries as cathartic cleansing."
In America,Mark Halverson,Sacramento News & Review,10.0,2008-8-7,
In America,Kam Williams,Princeton Town Topics,8.75,2007-4-22,"A sappy, self-congratulatory tale of triumph of penniless newcomers over every sort of adversity, and a close brush with death every time they set foot outside of their apartment."
In America,Emma Cochrane,Empire Magazine,8.0,2006-12-30,"Lovingly shot, with a remarkable debut from Sarah Bolger, who along with sister Emma, gives one of the greatest ever child performances."

In America,Ethan Alter,NYC Film Critic,7.0,2005-3-5,"A genuinely touching movie about a family that doesn't condescend to audiences or wrap its lessons into neat, tidy packages."
In America,JoBlo,JoBlo's Movie Network,8.0,2005-2-5,"Sheridan should also be applauded for keeping the film going at a nice pace, sprinkling it with many lighter moments, as well as one of the more suspenseful scenes from any movie last year."
I Am Sam,Michael Clark,Epoch Times,9.0,2022-8-10,"Penn never goes over the top with his speech, ticks, hand gestures, and all-around physicality. He doesn’t act like a mentally challenged man, he behaves like one: there’s a big difference between the two."
I Am Sam,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,8.75,2020-9-11,Penn's performance deserved the Oscar nomination.
I Am Sam,Nell Minow,Common Sense Media,6.0,2010-12-24,Moving film with great acting seems too contrived.
I Am Sam,Nick Rogers,Midwest Film Journal,0.0,2010-9-25,"Sean Penn gives the most professionally shameful, cruelly wrongheaded performance ever nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, while Jessie Nelson Kristine Johnson's script lives down to Penn's ugly ineptitude with idiotic catchphrases and product placement."

Black Hawk Down,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,5.0,2023-11-12,"For the most part, the unflagging sound and fury make it impossible to identify with these characters as individuals, since their primary function seems to be to serve as anonymous slabs of American fortitude."
Black Hawk Down,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,10.0,2022-8-19,"“Black Hawk Down” is an intense, visceral experience. It's gritty action one minute and deeply moving the next. But it never loses sight of its main focus – the soldiers."
Black Hawk Down,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,7.0,2020-9-25,"Not nearly as potent as one might expect from this particular director, especially with a sizable budget and resources at his disposal, and governing this impressive cast."
Black Hawk Down,Leigh Paatsch,Herald Sun (Australia),9.0,2020-7-13,"Scott pares back story, character development and moral righteousness to their bare essentials, resulting in the most striking, if not revealing, portrait of modern warfare ever filmed."

Black Hawk Down,Nick Rogers,Midwest Film Journal,10.0,2010-9-25,"No film from the Zeroes - hell, maybe ever - more forcefully imparted the horrors of war as thoroughly, coherently and hauntingly. Even justified wars run rampant with monstrosities, and this showed just how critical camaraderie can be in conquering them."
Black Hawk Down,Brandon Fibbs,BrandonFibbs.com,8.0,2008-2-28,"While fine films like Saving Private Ryan depict warfare at its worst, they do not depict warfare in modernity. I cannot imagine a better representation of war, with all of its urban complexities, than Black Hawk Down."
Black Hawk Down,Joe Lozito,Big Picture Big Sound,7.5,2007-12-27,Action masters Ridley Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer prove that it is possible to extend the opening twenty minutes of Saving Private Ryan to two full hours. Now all they have to do is spend some of that time creating characters to care about.
Black Hawk Down,Mark Dinning,Empire Magazine,6.0,2006-12-30,"Ambitious, sumptuously-framed and frenetic, Black Hawk Down occasionally errs on the confused, but is nonetheless a rare find of a war movie which dares to turn genre convention on its head."
Road to Perdition,Namrata Joshi,Outlook,7.5,2019-1-3,A beautiful elegy to a decaying world whose sadness lingers on.
Road to Perdition,Mike Clark,USA Today,7.5,2013-4-14,So is Perdition still a must-see? No question. But it's tough to fuss about it much when a picture is this fussy.

Road to Perdition,Peter Canavese,Groucho Reviews,7.5,2010-8-2,The top-billed actors deliver: Hanks with his resonant reserve and Newman in conveying Rooney's failed attempt to live up to his self-image as the ultimate just and loving patriarch. [Blu-ray]
Road to Perdition,John J. Puccio,Movie Metropolis,8.0,2010-7-28,"...something more than the sum of its parts; namely, a gripping, touching, entertaining motion picture."
Road to Perdition,Daniel Etherington,Film4,8.0,2008-10-1,It's Newman who really stands out. Despite his advanced years -- he's 77 -- the man still has remarkable presence.
Road to Perdition,Mark Halverson,Sacramento News & Review,8.0,2008-8-7,"Hanks and Newman are the personification of anguish and torn loyalty in a gripping, violent film that is part character study and part cat-and-mouse chase with classic western embellishments."
Road to Perdition,Joe Lozito,Big Picture Big Sound,7.5,2007-7-14,"Road is so beautiful, so well composed and so tidy in its sense of justice that it never quite gets its hands dirty enough to evoke any true emotion."

Billy Elliot,Nick Rogers,Midwest Film Journal,8.75,2010-9-25,"The film about atypical artistic pursuits in a blue-collar community that ""The Full Monty"" sought to be.

Hedwig and the Angry Inch,Nicholas Bell,IONCINEMA.com,7.0,2020-8-14,Mitchell's performance and Stephen Trask's incredibly touching tracks allow for delirious cinematic spectacle. Mitchell's Hedwig... remains one of cinema's most heartbroken and heartbreaking cinematic chanteuses.
Hedwig and the Angry Inch,Nathanael Hood,The Retro Set,8.0,2020-1-9,The film hums with the plasticine kineticism of Terry Gilliam as the camera tilts and moves with all the abandon of one of Hedwig's shows.
Hedwig and the Angry Inch,Mattie Lucas,From the Front Row,8.75,2019-7-17,Brazenly breaks down the holy silos of the masculine and the feminine gender binary and revels in the ambiguity between.
Hedwig and the Angry Inch,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,10.0,2019-6-29,"Mitchell's performance as Hedwig remains one of the best of modern times -- the character is by turns sexy, scary, outrageous, obnoxious, pitiable and vulnerable -- and it anchors a movie that landed on my list of the 10 best films of the 2000s."
Hedwig and the Angry Inch,Tim Brayton,Antagony & Ecstasy,9.0,2016-12-4,One of the few modern movie musicals that deserves to stand alongside the classics of the genre.
Hedwig and the Angry Inch,David Keyes,Cinemaphile.org,10.0,2015-8-25,"Most movie musicals often use songs to create an exaggerated exterior of polished images, but here is one that uses them to reveal honesty that seems too painful to explain in mere conversation."
Hedwig and the Angry Inch,Josh Larsen,LarsenOnFilm,8.75,2014-8-25,...a swath of glittery eye shadow splashed across mainstream American movie screens.
Hedwig and the Angry Inch,Nick Rogers,Midwest Film Journal,10.0,2010-9-24,"A ball of gender confusion, Biblical allegories and Eastern European politics -one of those would be a tricky subtext for a 90-minute rock opera. But the songs marry Jim Steinman's grandeur to the Stooges' sweat and spit, with a deft, tender screenplay."
Hedwig and the Angry Inch,Ken Hanke,"Mountain Xpress (Asheville, NC)",10.0,2010-9-16,"One of the most delightful surprises of 2001, and it has lost none of its charm or its surprising power in the intervening years."
Hedwig and the Angry Inch,Kim Newman,Empire Magazine,8.0,2006-12-30,Definitely recommended for those looking for something different.

Office Space,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,7.5,2021-2-19,...exceedingly pleasant and sporadically hilarious...
Office Space,Carey-Ann Pawsey,Orca Sound,6.0,2019-3-17,"Not only made a satire on office life, but makes comments on white guys listening to gangster rap and inherent racism in the United States. For those who can relate to dying a little every day in a cubicle this is the film for you."
Office Space,Jami Bernard,New York Daily News,7.5,2016-2-19,"With a judiciously executed hip-hop soundtrack and the same anti-conformist spirit that informs Judge's TV cartoons, ""Office Space"" can expect to attract people who aren't even old enough to be stuck in dead-end jobs."
Office Space,Ann Hornaday,Baltimore Sun,7.5,2013-11-4,"Imagine a live-action version of Dilbert, or In the Company of Men reconceived as a lighthearted romp, and you get the idea of Office Space, the auspicious live-action debut of Mike Judge."
Office Space,Jason Caro,Radio Times,6.0,2013-11-2,This unconventional satire of work relationships and office politics is one of the oddest studio comedies in years.
Office Space,David Sterritt,Christian Science Monitor,7.5,2013-11-2,"The creator of Beavis and Butt- Head has made a laid-back, even subtle comedy that generally favors mischievous ironies over outlandish jokes."

Training Day,Jeff Beck,The Blu Spot,7.0,2023-2-27,"Training Day may have a somewhat basic storyline, but it still offers up a mostly-engaging look at its subject, with a pair of outstanding & compelling performances from its stars that give the film the extra oomph it needs."
Training Day,Danielle Solzman,Solzy at the Movies,8.0,2023-2-27,Training Day would not be the film it is without the gritty authenticity for its time.
Training Day,Amy Bracken Sparks,Cleveland Free Times,7.5,2021-10-26,"The sly casting of the charismatic Washington, who comes with built-in righteousness cred, helps this rise above some ill-considered third-act twists and anticlimaxes."
Training Day,Stephen Silver,Tilt Magazine,8.0,2021-10-14,"Training Day painted a picture of a Los Angeles where the cops may be dirty, but the streets are choked with dangerous criminals. (20th anniversary)"
Training Day,Leigh Paatsch,Herald Sun (Australia),7.0,2020-9-11,"This could have been just another corrupt-cop thriller if it wasn't for the involvement of Denzel Washington, who works spectacularly against type in to come up with one of the more memorable screen villains."
Training Day,PJ Nabarro,Patrick Nabarro,6.0,2018-12-9,"Training Day is not a completely unnuanced parable on policing and a nice disavowal of the movie-perpetuated cliché of smug, streetwise copdom."
Training Day,Nell Minow,Common Sense Media,6.0,2010-12-29,"Great performances, but for adults only."

Rushmore,Wesley Lovell,Cinema Sight,7.5,2023-10-4,"Rushmore” is an interesting movie that will appeal to a very small audience, but will nonetheless impress."
Rushmore,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,6.25,2023-8-12,...a consistently watchable yet thoroughly erratic endeavor that fares best in its briskly-paced and tremendously entertaining first half...
Rushmore,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-25,...an infectious comedy from start to finish.
Rushmore,John Hartl,Seattle Times,10.0,2014-3-17,"There's an unshakable confidence about this coming-of-age fable that matches that of its central character, Max Fischer."
Rushmore,Andrew Pulver,Guardian,8.0,2014-3-17,Rushmore offers more than simply a series of high-grade yuks; it's a finely-judged parable on the line between self-delusion and reality.
Rushmore,David Sterritt,Christian Science Monitor,10.0,2014-3-17,"Anderson fulfills the promise of his inventive Bottle Rocket with this quirky, often hilarious comedy, and Murray gives his most uproarious performance since the groundbreaking Groundhog Day."
Rushmore,Ann Hornaday,Baltimore Sun,10.0,2014-3-17,"Despite cute moments, nothing about Rushmore begs to be liked, which makes this modest comedy all the more satisfying."
Rushmore,Dan Webster,Spokesman-Review (Washington),7.5,2014-3-17,"Just when you expect the film to do something normal, it takes off like Murray -- riffing on reality as only he, and filmmaker Anderson, can."
Rushmore,Serena Donadoni,"Metro Times (Detroit, MI)",9.0,2014-3-17,"It's somehow fitting that in this Maxcentric universe, Rushmore exists as a satirical comedy, full of dry wit and adolescent absurdities, and a bittersweet valentine to manipulative misfits who actually find the love they deserve."
Rushmore,Steven Rea,Philadelphia Inquirer,10.0,2014-3-17,"There's a danger of overselling Anderson's sweet-hearted, loony little fantasy, but everything -- from the soundtrack of '60s Brit bands with their jangly anthems of angsty love to Robert Yeoman's slightly hyper-real photography -- fits perfectly."

The Fifth Element,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,9.0,2020-9-11,Visionary filmmaker Luc Besson manages to create several of the most exotic and original characters for this magnum opus of sensory outlandishness.
The Fifth Element,Leigh Paatsch,Herald Sun (Australia),4.0,2020-6-12,"The brains behind The Fifth Element would have been better off adding a sixth element - common sense - to the plot, and allowing it to form a bridge between the film's fantastic visual appeal and its ramshackle plot."

Hamlet,S. Jhoanna Robledo,Common Sense Media,8.0,2011-6-21,"[David] Tennant is especially fun to watch as he mugs for the camera and alarms other characters while seemingly in the throes of madness. His goofy faces are tinged with despair, revealing the depths of Hamlet's misery."
Hamlet,Peter Canavese,Groucho Reviews,8.75,2010-5-31,"Tennant's restless Hamlet is never boring, and it's not irredeemably a stage performance on camera: at times--like the ever-intimidating 'To be or not to be speech'--Tennant curls up into fetal intimacy... [Blu-ray]"

Clerks,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,7.0,2022-7-11,"Though the individual parts – such as a few solid jokes, outlandish characters, and an outrageous quandary – tend to be more memorable than the whole, this ultra low-budget, independent project is undeniably impressive."
Clerks,David Gonzalez,The Cinematic Reel,10.0,2022-2-14,"After 22 years, Clerks remains a quintessential part of 90s independent cinema, and the start of the career of one of the most well-rounded directors and writers of this era, Kevin Smith."

Clerks,James Berardinelli,ReelViews,8.75,2008-6-10,"Nothing, no matter how outrageous, is beyond Smith, and his willingness to flaunt cinematic taboos is one of the reasons why Clerks is such a unqualified success."
Clerks,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,6.25,2006-7-23,...the film's inherent deficiencies are generally overshadowed by the distinctly earnest vibe.
Clerks,Emanuel Levy,EmanuelLevy.Com,7.5,2006-6-1,"Smith dogpiles absurdity and obscenity on top of each other. The dullness of the dead-end jobs is brightened by bizarre bits--a fat guy asking for softer toilet paper, drops dead on the toilet."

Philadelphia,David Keyes,Cinemaphile.org,10.0,2015-6-14,"Jonathan Demme's thoughtful human drama was certainly not the first movie to confront the AIDS crisis, but it was, even in the conventional skin of a courtroom drama, the most heartbreaking and passionate undertaking of its kind."
Philadelphia,Peter Canavese,Groucho Reviews,6.25,2013-5-29,"What remains most striking about Philadelphia may be the...conspicuous emphasis on intense close-ups. They force an inescapable emotional intimacy in relation to issues the mainstream, at least at the time, would rather have looked away from. [Blu-ray]"

Glengarry Glen Ross,Emanuel Levy,EmanuelLevy.Com,8.0,2006-8-17,"Mamet has a special gift for drawing portriats of lowlifers who are harsh but also funny, his salesmen are a far cry from Arthur Miller's Loman in Death of a Salesman."
Glengarry Glen Ross,Jeffrey M. Anderson,Combustible Celluloid,10.0,2006-5-26,"This brilliant, gutsy film features a nervy script by David Mamet and career-topping performances by Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey, Jonathan Pryce and Alec Baldwin."

Fried Green Tomatoes,Peter Freedman,Radio Times,8.0,2014-6-2,"Essentially a story about friendship between two pairs of women, then and now, it could be classified as an intelligent woman's picture, but this truly uplifting and gratifying movie can and should be enjoyed by all."
Fried Green Tomatoes,Desmond Ryan,Philadelphia Inquirer,7.5,2014-6-2,"Fried Green Tomatoes is a case of a film acted with such skill and conviction that glaring problems of narrative, pace and structure seem like minor slips."
Fried Green Tomatoes,Dave Kehr,Chicago Tribune,5.0,2014-6-2,"The movie never quite shakes its stiff, studied feel, just as the town of Whistle Stop never stops seeming the quaint creation of an art director."

Who Framed Roger Rabbit,Allison Rose,FlickDirect,10.0,2021-12-7,"While Hoskins may not have been the first (or second or third or...) to play Eddie, he does a terrific job with it especially since he was co-starring alongside a non-existent talking rabbit."
Who Framed Roger Rabbit,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,8.0,2020-9-8,"Although the entire movie is incredibly creative and highly unique, it's the attention to details, both visually and through scripting, that truly sets it apart."
Who Framed Roger Rabbit,Rachel Wagner,Rachel's Reviews (YouTube),10.0,2019-2-21,It holds up very well today.
Who Framed Roger Rabbit,Christy Lemire,ChristyLemire.com,7.5,2018-5-29,"Technology has advanced significantly since 1988, but Roger Rabbit doesn't just hold up, it wows."
Who Framed Roger Rabbit,James White,Total Film,8.0,2013-7-30,"An ingenious blend of hand-drawn animation and live action, spliced with humour that's by turns madcap, surreal and violent, Roger Rabbit demonstrates that it's possible to push the technical boundaries while still cooking up decent characters and plots."
Who Framed Roger Rabbit,Tom Hutchinson,Radio Times,10.0,2013-7-30,This whizz-bang breakthrough in mixing live action with cartoon characters won a special achievement Oscar for animator Richard Williams.
Empire of the Sun,Michael Clark,Epoch Times,5.0,2023-8-29,"In the context of Spielberg’s overall output from a quality perspective, “Empire” lands just below the halfway point. Had it been made by a first-time director, it would’ve been considered impressive; instead, it serves as a perfunctory transition piece."
Empire of the Sun,Christopher Lloyd,The Film Yap,10.0,2023-4-3,"Steven Spielberg's most underappreciated film is still an emotional wallop, as a boy navigates POW life during World War II, desperately trying to find purchase for his passion."
Empire of the Sun,Danielle Solzman,Solzy at the Movies,9.0,2022-12-11,Empire of the Sun might be underappreciated but the film is in the upper tier of Steven Spielberg's filmography.
Empire of the Sun,Jo Berry,Radio Times,6.0,2016-10-26,"Now considered a trial run for the more moving, horrifying and involving Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg's drama, set in China during the Second World War, is a glossy and rather tame affair."
Empire of the Sun,Gene Siskel,Chicago Tribune,5.0,2016-10-26,This is derivative melodrama with Spielberg hedging his bets by ripping off his previous adventure films to lighten a story that cries out not to be turned into a comic book.
Blue Velvet,Savina Petkova,A Good Movie To Watch,9.2,2023-10-30,Dennis Hooper stars as one of the most terrifying men on screen and Lynch regular Angelo Badalamenti scores the film with an eerie precision like no other.
Blue Velvet,Joe Lipsett,Anatomy of a Scream Podcast Network,9.0,2023-7-4,"Daring, provocative and influential, Lynch's seminal ode to the rot that lurks just beneath the surface of suburban domesticity remains as potent today as it was back in 1986."
Blue Velvet,Mitchell Beaupre,Paste Magazine,10.0,2022-9-23,"Frank Booth’s introduction is one of the most memorable in screen history, a clear line where the film shifts to become something far more sinister."
Blue Velvet,David Reddish,Queerty,10.0,2022-3-20,"Rossellini gives one of the bravest, most uninhibited performances we've ever seen. Movies don't get more stylish or twisted than Blue Velvet. Love it, hate it, laugh or scream: all reactions are totally valid."
Blue Velvet,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-2-23,"To watch Blue Velvet is not to see only the dreadful, ugly parts of America; it's about seeing the world itself from a unique angle, which is to say, from the surreal perspective of David Lynch."
Blue Velvet,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,9.0,2020-8-31,"While many of Lynch's films are bizarre just for the sake of being bizarre, this one appears purposeful as an excavation of disconcerting characters in threatening situations."
Blue Velvet,Tim Brayton,Alternate Ending,8.0,2019-8-26,"This may not be the purely intuitive, spiritual-meaning-through-form filmmaking of the mature Lynch, but it is pretty great cinema."
Blue Velvet,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,7.5,2019-6-1,"Unlike most great movies, this one loses some of its power with each subsequent viewing."
Blue Velvet,C.H. Newell,Father Son Holy Gore,10.0,2019-5-6,"Blue Velvet takes place in a space where violence is always possible, never far; its threat is debilitating to the progression of everything from innocence to love."
Blue Velvet,David Jenkins,Little White Lies,10.0,2016-12-2,Every viewing yields new insights. A berserko modern classic.
Blue Velvet,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,10.0,2016-12-1,The film releases a toxic narcosis of fear.
Blue Velvet,Jamie Graham,Total Film,10.0,2016-12-1,"Isabella Rossellini's singer Dorothy is a heart-rending open wound, Dennis Hopper's Frank Booth one of cinema's great nutjobs, and Lynch's control a thing of nightmarish beauty."
Zelig,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,8.75,2022-11-7,"Gordon Willis' work on this picture is astounding, as he and writer-director-star Woody Allen work in tandem to create a brilliant faux-documentary."
Zelig,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,8.0,2022-9-22,"Excellently paced, smartly conceived, cleverly written, and impressively different from writer/director Woody Allen’s previous efforts."
Zelig,Mattie Lucas,From the Front Row,8.75,2019-6-5,"Almost pure Allen id, an exploration of his own eagerness to be liked."
Zelig,David Keyes,Cinemaphile.org,8.75,2019-6-3,"If the sum of Allen's career can be seen as a series of destinations on a road to self-discovery, then this strange, off-the-cuff ""mockumentary"" provides the most unlikely roadmap."
Zelig,Matt Brunson,Creative Loafing,8.75,2016-8-7,"Gordon Willis' work on this picture is astounding, as he and writer-director-star Woody Allen work in tandem to create a brilliant faux-documentary."
Zelig,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,10.0,2011-12-22,"A masterpiece: a brilliant, even passionate historical pastiche, a superbly pregnant meditation on American society and individuality, and an eerie fantasy that will live in your dreams."
Zelig,Jennie Kermode,Eye for Film,8.0,2011-12-16,
Zelig,Cole Smithey,ColeSmithey.com,8.0,2008-10-22,
Zelig,Chuck O'Leary,FulvueDrive-in.com,6.0,2007-5-7,
Zelig,Steve Crum,Dispatch-Tribune Newspapers,10.0,2006-12-8,"Hilarious Woody Allen vehicle, a mockumentary with special effects ahead of its time."
Zelig,Tom Huddleston,Time Out,8.0,2006-6-24,"The comedy tends to the smirk-inducing rather than the laugh-out-loud, and the second half wanders somewhat, but Zelig is a strong contender for Allen's most fascinating film."
First Blood,Allison Rose,FlickDirect,7.0,2024-4-8,"Director Ted Kotcheff offers some stunning visuals, making First Blood not only a pleasure to watch but a study in directing."
First Blood,Eddie Harrison,film-authority.com,10.0,2023-7-1,"…Ted Kotcheff’s terse action thriller is a significant American film that changed culture and politics back in 1982, and still packs an 89 minute punch today…"
First Blood,Kevin Maher,Times (UK),8.0,2022-6-24,"Stallone brought intense physicality, obviously, but also hangdog vulnerability to a character who takes revenge on a cruel, unfeeling establishment and utters some of the most iconic lines in shoot’em’up history."
First Blood,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,6.0,2022-6-23,Watchable if entirely preposterous...
First Blood,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,9.0,2020-9-6,Pushed-to-the-edge survivalist John Rambo raised the bar significantly for action heroes.
First Blood,Richard Freedman,Newhouse News Service,5.0,2020-5-12,"Considerably ""less thoughtful than, say, Coming Home on a similar subject, First Blood so revels In sadism that Its high-minded pretenses are quickly washed away in blood -- first, last and always."
First Blood,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,7.5,2019-9-22,The first and best of the franchise.
First Blood,Sean Mulvihill,FanboyNation.com,8.0,2018-11-19,There's no trace of the Rambo that would become the symbol of American militaristic excess of the '80s in First Blood.
First Blood,Andrew Pollard,Starburst,8.0,2018-11-6,"First Blood is first and foremost an oft-overlooked war classic, spinning the focus and looking at the very real and painful fallout for those involved in such traumatic events."
First Blood,Matt Brunson,Creative Loafing,6.25,2012-9-13,"The character of John Rambo is so identified with Stallone that it's amusing to note how many actors were considered for the role, including Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro."
First Blood,Kevin Carr,7M Pictures,10.0,2012-8-15,"a powerful, complex and captivating film that serves as a blockbuster action film and a serious drama"
First Blood,Charles Cassady,Common Sense Media,6.0,2010-12-14,"First and most popular Rambo; and yes, bloody."
First Blood,James Berardinelli,ReelViews,7.5,2009-4-30,"The darker tone, somber subtext, and generally non-exploitative violence allow viewers to enjoy the film not only as an action/thriller but as something with a degree of intelligence and substance."
Ordinary People,Danielle Solzman,Solzy at the Movies,9.0,2023-5-23,"While the subject content brings about some heavy themes that are not easy to discuss, Robert Redford hits it out of the park with Ordinary People."
Ordinary People,Dann Gire,Chicago Daily Herald,10.0,2022-7-20,Ordinary People is rare moviemaking and easily one of the best films of 1980. But to spurt volumes of superlatives would not do it justice. Redford's film is deceptively quiet and subtle.
Ordinary People,John Lapsley,The Sun-Herald (Australia),10.0,2022-7-15,"Alvin Sargent's devastatingly realist screenplay adaptation of the novel by a Minneapolis housewife, Judith Guest, sounds like the transcript of a typical civilised family's roundtable non-discussion."
Love and Death,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,8.75,2023-2-13,"The picture is packed front to back with cheery bon mots --- to say nothing of rollicking slapstick sequences, spoofy film homages, and other modes of merriment guaranteed to keep viewers in perpetual guffaw."
Love and Death,Michael Scheinfeld,TV Guide,8.0,2019-5-23,"Technically, the film is one of Allen's most accomplished, handsomely filmed in Hungary and France by Ghislain Cloquet, which helps make the hysterical anachronistic sight gags stand out even more."
Love and Death,John A. Nesbit,Old School Reviews,8.0,2008-10-26,

Love and Death,Eric Lurio,Greenwich Village Gazette,8.0,2005-6-27,
Love and Death,Rich Cline,Shadows on the Wall,6.0,2005-4-18,silly and likable
Love and Death,Roger Ebert,Chicago Sun-Times,8.75,2004-10-23,Love and Death has been mapped out as a fully thought-through film. It's a lot more mature than the anything-goes style of earlier Allen movies like Bananas.

The Taking of Pelham One Two Three,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,10.0,2021-4-1,...masterful...
The Taking of Pelham One Two Three,David Parkinson,Radio Times,8.0,2021-3-7,"Sargent keeps the focus firmly on his leads. Shaw is admirably fanatical, and the world-weary, wisecracking Matthau is magnificent."
The Taking of Pelham One Two Three,Grant Watson,Fiction Machine,10.0,2020-7-22,"It is in essence a flawless film: you could improve bits and pieces perhaps, but there is nothing in the film that doesn't work."
The Taking of Pelham One Two Three,Roger Ebert,Chicago Sun-Times,7.5,2018-4-29,"What's good about Pelham's example of the form is that the performances are allowed enough leeway so that we care about the people not the plot mechanics. And what could have been formula trash turns out to be fairly classy trash, after all."
The Taking of Pelham One Two Three,Bill Goodykoontz,Arizona Republic,8.0,2009-6-10,"The original version of The Taking of Pelham One Two Three was made 35 years ago, yet it retains a quality of cool that will remain long after people have forgotten the current version."
The Taking of Pelham One Two Three,Chris Cabin,Filmcritic.com,8.0,2009-6-8,An archeological specimen from nearly two decades before the advent of the Metrocard
The Taking of Pelham One Two Three,Josh Larsen,LarsenOnFilm,7.5,2009-6-7,"...a quintessential 1970s New York picture, full of prickly characters and urban tension."
Blazing Saddles,Kathleen Carroll,New York Daily News,8.75,2023-1-30,"Brooks' western is anything but typical. It is a brazen, punch-drunk, free-swinging spoof of every sagebrush saga that ever came down the Hollywood trail."
Blazing Saddles,Danielle Solzman,Solzy at the Movies,10.0,2022-3-9,"Blazing Saddles, the 1974 film starring Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder, is one of the best comedies ever made in the history of cinema."
Blazing Saddles,Kevin Carr,Fat Guys at the Movies,10.0,2021-11-25,It's really not as politically incorrect as people think. It's sending up traditional racism.
Blazing Saddles,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,7.0,2020-8-27,"Despite the narrative shortcomings, many of the gags are outstanding."
Blazing Saddles,Tim Brayton,Alternate Ending,8.0,2018-7-4,An extraordinarily gutsy film.
Serpico,Ed Potton,Times (UK),8.0,2023-8-18,... One of Hollywood’s most wince-inducing explorations of police corruption.
Serpico,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,10.0,2023-8-16,Sweat and grit and fear pulse off it like waves; and there are dynamic streetscape scenes.
Serpico,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,6.0,2023-8-9,"Though Pacino delivers an iconic performance, the pacing here is largely off, as it builds, mostly suspense-free, to an ending that is already known - thanks to the opening moments."
Serpico,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,7.0,2023-7-24,"In the end the strengths of Lumet’s direction, Pacino’s performance, and Arthur J. Ornitz’s gritty cinematography are more than enough to get past the film’s handful of stumbles."
Serpico,Ian Kane,Epoch Times,8.0,2023-5-13,...is a gripping depiction of a man who put his life at risk while refusing to compromise his sense of justice and integrity.
Serpico,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,8.75,2023-4-27,"Serpico feels like a deeply cynical and suspicious picture, but this is tempered by its faith in the unflagging decency of its central crusader."
Serpico,Danielle Solzman,Solzy at the Movies,9.0,2023-4-18,Al Pacino is absolutely phenomenal as a police officer fighting corruption in Serpico.
Enter the Dragon,Patrick Hicks,Feelin' Film Podcast,7.0,2023-8-21,Bruce Lee is the star and that's why we watch. Bare bones plot. No apologies. All action. All fun.
Enter the Dragon,Kevin Maher,Times (UK),8.0,2023-8-11,And yet when the fisticuffs eventually arrive — on a James Bond-style island where an evil crime lord is hosting an international kung fu-themed tournament of death — they’re impossibly satisfying.
Enter the Dragon,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,8.0,2023-8-9,[Lee's] balletic moves are a joy and the traditional nunchuck showoff display is mesmeric – it’s why we can forgive this film for the slightly lower-octane scenes when he’s not in them.
Enter the Dragon,Allison Rose,FlickDirect,10.0,2023-8-8,Enter the Dragon set the standard for Martial Arts movies that has been imitated time and time again.
Enter the Dragon,Jennie Kermode,Eye for Film,9.0,2023-6-15,Lee is terrific and his natural charisma gives the film the energy it needs.
Enter the Dragon,Gene Siskel,Chicago Tribune,3.75,2023-3-20,One of the most hateful films In years. Its story is a shameful copy of Dr. No. Its dialog approaches the infantile. Its characters are cruel parodies of human beings. Its subliminal message is morally bankrupt.
Enter the Dragon,Jerry Oster,New York Daily News,3.75,2023-3-20,"Enter the Dragon, the latest kung fu migraine, is slick junk."
Deliverance,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,8.0,2022-8-20,"Anchored by some solid performances, strong direction, and a sharp aesthetic, “Deliverance” creates an atmosphere as threatening as it is beautiful and throws it’s characters right in the middle of it."
Deliverance,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,7.0,2020-8-29,Not so much a cautionary tale as one of uncommon doggedness.
Deliverance,Leigh Paatsch,Herald Sun (Australia),8.0,2019-9-6,"This gripping drama was a controversial release back in the early 70s, and its distressing intensity hasn't really diminished in the decades since.Just remember, once you go with its powerful flow, there ain't no turnin' back."
Deliverance,Josh Larsen,LarsenOnFilm,8.75,2018-9-10,"...an ecological, existential nightmare."

Deliverance,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,3.75,2014-12-24,...an underwhelming adaptation of an underwhelming book.
Deliverance,David Keyes,Cinemaphile.org,10.0,2014-8-19,"Boorman's film still speaks to us in profound ways, as if to indicate hidden wisdom has long rested in frames glossed up by a once-shocking philosophy."
Deliverance,Matt Brunson,Creative Loafing,10.0,2012-7-13,"This powerful adaptation of James Dickey's best-selling novel finds director John Boorman establishing a sense of menace almost from the start, and the ""squeal like a pig"" sequence continues to haunt viewers even decades after the fact."
Deliverance,Peter Canavese,Groucho Reviews,10.0,2012-7-3,"Boorman's interpretation of the material resulted in an American cinematic classic built not only on shock and awe, but emotional subtlety. [Blu-ray]"

Dirty Harry,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,8.75,2021-12-16,"Director Don Siegel's classic sci-fi flick Invasion of the Body Snatchers was alternately read as both right-wing (anti-Commie) and left-wing (anti-McCarthyism), and he found his controversial police thriller experiencing the same sort of dichotomy."
Dirty Harry,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,8.75,2021-12-9,...essentially the template for play-by-his-own-rules cop pictures...
Dirty Harry,Josh Larsen,LarsenOnFilm,3.75,2021-9-2,...a straw-man movie.
Dirty Harry,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,10.0,2020-8-29,"He's one of the coolest unethical cops around, sporting a mean hand-cannon, an attitude of proportional size, and witty dialogue that consistently sizzles."
Dirty Harry,Charles Cassady,Common Sense Media,6.0,2010-9-14,'70s rebel-cop classic is way too edgy for kids.
Dirty Harry,Scott Nash,Three Movie Buffs,10.0,2010-6-20,An iconic performance by Clint Eastwood creates a cinematic immortal.
Dirty Harry,Tony Macklin,tonymacklin.net,8.0,2009-3-1,"Don Siegel's Dirty Harry is an apt example of a film with a vision that few people perceive beyond its violent, flamboyant surfaces.

Where Eagles Dare,Leigh Paatsch,Herald Sun (Australia),8.0,2020-4-27,"A classic of its time, this riveting WWII drama is rife with great action sequences (the cable car!) and shock twists pulled out of thin air. Three escapist hours very well spent."

The Odd Couple,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,7.0,2020-8-27,Lemmon and Matthau have an undeniable chemistry that allows their highly contrasting personalities to generate a fitting camaraderie and plenty of comical conundrums.
The Odd Couple,Yasser Medina,Cinefilia,6.0,2020-7-24,"I enjoy some moments of this comedy directed by Gene Saks when I see the fabulous pair of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, although the tour is somewhat repetitive and superficial. [Full review in Spanish]"

The Dirty Dozen,Wanda Hale,New York Daily News,10.0,2020-11-19,"An abundance of hilarious humor, injected by Mr. Aldrich, the star, Lee Marvin and the cast, is a blessed relief from the strain of gory details and grim aspects of war, fought by a mere handful of American on foreign soil."

Belle de jour,Ryan Pollard,Starburst,8.0,2017-10-4,"Belle de Jour is a film that's ambiguous and alluring in equal measure, and while that can be alienating for modern audiences, this is a film that is still radical, thought provoking and enticing after 50 years."
Belle de jour,David Parkinson,Radio Times,10.0,2017-9-7,Deneuve is utterly beguiling in a movie shifting between dream and reality with such deft sleights of hand that we are never sure whether we are watching episodes from Sverine's life or sharing her fantasies.

Repulsion,Simon Miraudo,Quickflix,9.0,2014-10-21,"The young Catherine Deneuve (she was 22 at the time of filming) gives a performance so unsettling and so precise, I can barely believe she grew into such a confident screen presence."

Zulu,PJ Nabarro,Patrick Nabarro,6.0,2022-2-19,Zulu stands the test of time by uncannily understanding itself as something of a chamber piece and by making atmosphere and suspense the centrepiece of its narrative rather than just the gratification of combat.

Zulu,Pablo Villaça,Cinema em Cena,6.0,2009-5-1,"Responsvel por lanar a carreira de Caine, o filme merece crditos tambm por evitar retratar os zulus como caricaturas selvagens, mas, mesmo que seja hbil ao criar uma atmosfera de urgncia e desespero, acaba tornando-se longo demais."
Zulu,Christopher Null,Filmcritic.com,6.0,2006-1-31,"Though, there's an awful lot of lounging around in the hut and a lot of buildup to the battle itself, which doesn't get underway for more than half the film."

Goldfinger,Victor Pineyro,Seventh Art Studio,8.0,2022-6-22,"Almost everything about this movie is unforgettable.

The Magnificent Seven,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,6.25,2021-8-18,"The action scenes are well-staged if deeply impersonal - in fact, much of the film feels rote and mechanical, less a vibrant throwback to vintage Westerns and more a marketing campaign in search of meaning."
The Magnificent Seven,Michael J. Casey,Michael J. Cinema,4.0,2021-6-23,"A safe, by-the-numbers remake of two classics designed to make money."
The Magnificent Seven,Richard Crouse,Richard Crouse,8.0,2021-3-1,"Could be leaner and well, maybe not meaner - I would not be surprised if it had the highest body count in a western eve r- but tighter."

Just Mercy,Dan Bayer,Next Best Picture,7.0,2022-5-13,"This is still an important story to tell, and if the film doesn’t do anything interesting or exciting with the material, it is still solid and ends on a high note. It works, and there’s nothing more it needs to do than that."
Just Mercy,Victoria Luxford,City AM,6.0,2022-2-21,"Although Just Mercy is a little long at more than two hours  it may have been better told as a miniseries  and takes a while to get going, its worth persevering with for the heartfelt portrayal of this remarkable man."

Just Mercy,Tara Brady,Irish Times,8.0,2021-2-11,"Foxx does his best work in a decade. For the charismatic Jordan, who puts in a tone-setting nuanced turn here, Just Mercy arrives between Creed II and Tom Clancy's Without Remorse. Let's hope he sticks with the ""one for them, one for me"" formula."

Just Mercy,Ty Burr,Boston Globe,6.25,2021-2-11,"Unlike many movies ""based on a true story,"" ""Just Mercy"" sticks close to the facts of the case - for the simple reason that the facts are drama enough."

The Peanut Butter Falcon,Cris Kennedy,The Canberra Times (Australia),8.0,2022-8-16,"The importance of the family you make, rather than the one you're given, is at the heart of this low-budget independent American feature that just happens to have two enormous Hollywood names on the marquee."

Bridge of Spies,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,8.75,2022-5-12,"From start to finish, Bridge of Spies is an engrossing, expertly made picture from Spielberg, and its historical merits, paired with its contemporary political relevancies, make it a supremely important American film for today."

Incredibles 2,Don Shanahan,Every Movie Has a Lesson,8.0,2023-9-4,"Incredibles 2 may not pack the usual signature “Pixar Punch” that sends stock in Kleenex skyrocketing, but the movie’s themes are formulated with deft wit, proper prudence, and enough meaningful magic."
Incredibles 2,Dallas King,Flick Feast,10.0,2022-11-10,The superhero genre has come a long way since the original in 2004... yet it is a credit to Brad Bird’s script and filmmaking style that Incredibles 2 feels like the perfect superhero movie for this particular time.

Incredibles 2,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-3-11,"It's everything we've waited for and wanted in a follow-up to Bird's 2004 original, instantly making the fourteen-year interim seem like a blip in animation history."

Incredibles 2,Zehra Phelan,Flavourmag,8.0,2020-7-22,"It doesn't try to be funny, it just effortless is. It's a heartfelt joy with a commendable stab at social commentary. A roller coaster of a ride this is one sequel and superhero movie that beats the enemy with graceful joy."

Moana,Mattie Lucas,From the Front Row,7.5,2019-6-5,"While the sounds don't always fit perfectly, it's remarkable how natural they often seem, providing a more accessible portrait of Savai'i, even if it is no longer 100% authentic."

Leviafan,David Harris,Spectrum Culture,8.0,2019-11-27,"Leviathan is not only a beautifully shot film, but a successful protest, even if all its characters fight the law and lose."
Leviafan,Nicholas Bell,IONCINEMA.com,9.0,2019-9-19,Andrey Zvyagintsev succeeds in cinematic sublimity with this multilayered and operatic exploration of the crushing corruption of an unchecked regime.
Leviafan,C.J. Prince,Way Too Indie,9.5,2019-6-29,"Leviathan truly is a sight to behold, a purely sensory experience and one of the most visceral films ever made."
Leviafan,Tom Bond,One Room With A View,8.0,2019-5-31,"Leviathan starts slowly and you can occasionally feel its hefty running time but after the raucous and game-changing drunken barbecue, secrets are exposed and the drama becomes engrossing."
Leviafan,Patrick Gamble,CineVue,10.0,2019-4-3,"Leviathan is veiled in a crude approximation of beauty thanks to Phillip Glass's rousing symphony and the tenebrous cinematography of Mikhail Kirchman that is at once anatomical, and at the same time deeply poetic."
Hell or High Water,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,8.75,2023-5-31,"A savory mix of a compelling narrative, several complex characters, and a handful of morally ambiguous situations."
Hell or High Water,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,8.0,2022-8-21,"There is a pretty significant plot-hole in the final act that I can’t quite shake, but otherwise “Hell or High Water” sticks its landing."
Hell or High Water,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,7.5,2022-4-11,"Mackenzie describes his film's characters with richness and depth, and each is afforded gradations by both the screenplay and performances."
Hell or High Water,Mark Jackson,Epoch Times,7.0,2022-2-25,"Robbing banks was very 1800s; robbing by banks was very 2010s. Robbing robber banks in ""Hell or Highwater"" makes it a post-Occupy Neo-Western. Pine, Foster, and Bridges kill it. Apropos again in 2022, with rumors of account-freezing by banks circulating."
Hell or High Water,Tim Appelo,AARP Movies for Grownups,10.0,2022-1-13,Taylor Sheridan (Yellowstone) wrote the perfect flick for Western-loving grownups.
Hell or High Water,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,5.0,2020-12-5,"The lead duo are hugely unsympathetic, while their motives are slight and unfulfilling - making their high-stakes endeavors far less than suspenseful."
Hell or High Water,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,10.0,2020-9-10,"Unquestionably one of the best films of 2016, Hell or High Water benefits greatly from an ensemble cast that acts like an ensemble cast."

Hell or High Water,Allison Rose,FlickDirect,10.0,2019-9-27,"I'm not sure Jeff Bridges makes a bad film anymore, but if he does, he is usually the bright spot. True to form, he plays his character well."

Philomena,James Croot,Stuff.co.nz,9.0,2023-1-30,Judi Dench's greatest screen performance...
Philomena,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,7.0,2022-8-24,"While several dramatic liberties were taken with the actual true account, most of them help make this a better film."
Philomena,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,7.5,2022-8-19,"The restrained realism and depth of the melodrama are perfectly balanced, altogether avoiding what could have easily become schmaltzy."
Philomena,Richard Crouse,Richard Crouse,8.0,2021-2-1,"Transcends its roots as a class study, becoming instead a poignant and funny story of forgiveness and the true nature of love."
Philomena,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,8.0,2020-12-4,It's a brooding mystery that focuses more on studying characters than unearthing clues.
Philomena,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,6.25,2020-9-20,It features a deeply felt and gripping performance from Judi Dench.
Philomena,Nicholas Bell,IONCINEMA.com,7.0,2019-8-29,"It's intelligently written and genuinely performed, even if the film is rather visually banal."
Philomena,Mattie Lucas,"The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)",7.5,2019-7-4,"Director Stephen Frears overplays his hand occasionally, but the film is balanced by some fine performances and a delicate script by Coogan."
Philomena,Chris Davies,One Room With A View,6.0,2019-6-7,"Surprisingly harrowing at times, the film avoids becoming an overwrought melodrama through the balance in characterisation between Martin's cynicism and Philomena's faith."
Philomena,Julie Crawford,"North Shore News (Vancouver, B.C.)",8.0,2019-4-17,"Ultimately, Philomena is a film about faith, family and and forgiveness, making it perfect holiday viewing."
Philomena,Bernard Boo,Way Too Indie,7.4,2019-4-9,"The film's tone is bittersweet, with Philomena's deep-seated regret propelling the duo's journey forward at a gentle glide."
Philomena,Daniel Green,CineVue,4.0,2019-3-6,"Dench is undoubtedly Philomena's shining light, pouring warmth and heart into the film's remorse-racked heroine. Unfortunately, however, neither Coogan nor his script prove anything like her equals."
Philomena,PJ Nabarro,Patrick Nabarro,6.0,2019-2-1,"Because the tale is so inherently emotional with its subject matter, all you need is a competent director and a couple of crack actors to wheedle that trajectory out."
Philomena,Debbie Baldwin,Ladue News,5.0,2018-11-3,"The humor is forced and awkward, and the film struggles with the message it is trying to send."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,Don Shanahan,Every Movie Has a Lesson,10.0,2024-4-7,"""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" maintains a credible tone of seriousness over farce while operating as evocative post-apocalyptic science fiction."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,7.0,2022-8-20,"There is some great action, awesome effects, and the performances are strong (none better than the stunning work of Andy Serkis)."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,8.75,2022-8-5,"It's one of the most intelligent films of 2014, and yet, despite its lofty intellectual ambitions, never for a moment does the film skimp on its blockbuster thrills or summer movie requirements."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,Dan Brightmore,NME (New Musical Express),8.0,2021-5-25,"As pure escapism it can work, but it's reassuring to experience a film able to deliver both blockbuster visual thrills and characters you care about."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,Richard Crouse,Richard Crouse,9.0,2021-2-1,"A smart movie about race, gun usage and xenophobia. Its masked in allegory but it doesn't shy away from big ideas and that's the thing that transforms it from a run-of-the-mill air conditioner flick to a thought provoking night and exciting at the movies."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,8.0,2020-12-4,"Though it may be a single component to a larger picture, which will likely see director Matt Reeves return to finish off the tale, it's wholly enjoyable all by itself."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,8.75,2020-9-5,"Serkis, and maybe even Kebbell, deserve awards attention here for their nothing short of inspiring performances."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,Kelechi Ehenulo,Confessions From A Geek Mind,9.0,2020-7-16,"[Andy Serkis] has become the Roddy McDowall of Planet of the Apes franchise, delivering the emotion and heart that makes Caesar come to life just like his predecessor did as Cornelius."

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,Katie Smith-Wong,Flick Feast,8.0,2019-11-20,"The result is a powerful, well-structured yet slightly biased sequel that further justifies the Planet of the Apes reboot or at least the origins of the franchise."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,Nicholas Bell,IONCINEMA.com,6.0,2019-8-30,"There are enough impressive elements to power through its basic tendencies, due mostly to the riveting special effects and primate storylines, and yet another aggressively engaging presence from Andy Serkis."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,Leslie Combemale,Cinema Siren,10.0,2019-8-2,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the tonic that proves brilliant, deep films can be made by a Hollywood major."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,Mattie Lucas,"The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)",7.5,2019-7-5,"In a world where simple black and white morality is popular, there are few Hollywood films, especially with this large a budget, that could ever tackle such complex thematic material."

A Star Is Born,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,8.0,2022-8-19,"While the story of “A Star is Born” may be familiar, there are enough good choices from Bradley Cooper to make his version of this ‘oft told tale’ feel fresh."
A Star Is Born,M.N. Miller,Ready Steady Cut,8.0,2022-8-17,A Star Is Born is an example of top-flight romantic escapism
A Star Is Born,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,8.75,2022-3-11,"It's not easy to capture performances this raw, nor to write and perform songs as good as ""The Shallow,"" as mournful as ""Maybe It's Time,"" or as badass as ""Black Eyes."" Cooper does it all to an impressive degree."

Despicable Me,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,5.0,2023-8-18,"This is a kids’ movie in the worst sense, meaning children will get the most from the experience. Adults might moderately enjoy it; however, the movie fails to transcend demographics in the way animated movies should."
Despicable Me,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,8.0,2022-8-20,The humor blends in nicely with a sweet and emotional tone that can be found throughout the film. Then there is the predictable but warm ending which wraps the movie up nicely.
Despicable Me,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,3.0,2020-11-29,"Bogged down by vapid clichés, overused ideas, and excruciating immaturity."
Despicable Me,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,8.75,2020-9-6,"Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier and Elsie Fisher capture beautifully all the innocence, vulnerability and wonder of childhood with complete conviction."
Despicable Me,Sarah Knight Adamson,Sarah's Backstage Pass,7.5,2020-1-14,"The jokes are fresh and very funny. Gru is a likable, lovable villain whose accent adds to the wackiness of the script."

Despicable Me,Joshua Starnes,ComingSoon.net,5.0,2011-3-18,"Despicable Me is bright and pretty enough that kids will like it, which is certainly its aim. It's also brainless, heartless and soulless."
Moneyball,Danilo Castro,Next Best Picture,8.0,2023-7-7,"“Moneyball” is expertly constructed, so it should come as no surprise that it was penned by two of the best screenwriters of the last thirty years: Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin."

La piel que habito,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-2-27,"There's never been another Almodovar film quite like The Skin I Live In, a complex thriller that, much like the filmmakers career, transitions from one kind of movie to another, shifting the audience's sympathies in unexpected and challenging ways."
La piel que habito,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,7.5,2019-8-3,An objectively oddball piece of work...
La piel que habito,Kelly Jane Torrance,Washington Examiner,8.75,2019-1-5,"The Skin I Live In is the most disquieting film I've seen in years. Don't let that stop you from seeing it, though. It's also the masterpiece we've long awaited from Pedro Almodovar."
La piel que habito,James Berardinelli,ReelViews,7.5,2018-12-20,The Skin I Live In is well worth seeing. Mad scientists overwhelmed by hubris are nothing new but no iteration of the story has been told in quite this way.

Zombieland,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,8.0,2020-11-29,"Complete with spectacular gore, creative cursing, outrageous slow-motion ransacking, a modest amount of romance, and a tour of the palatial Bill Murray estate."
Zombieland,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,8.75,2020-9-27,"In an extended cameo, Bill Murray shows up with his own brand of dry, yet over-the-top humor that may very well serve as the film's highlight."

Die Welle,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,7.5,2011-12-9,The inclusion of an engrossing (yet expected) finale ensures that The Wave ends on an exceedingly positive note...
Die Welle,Kalvin Henely,Slant Magazine,3.75,2011-6-3,"The Wave is top-heavy and light-footed, racing its winning idea-that fascism can still be attractive to some, even in modern Germany-past itself."
Die Welle,Jeannette Catsoulis,New York Times,5.0,2011-5-26,"""The Wave"" feels overdetermined and ploddingly dramatized."
Die Welle,Derek Malcolm,London Evening Standard,6.0,2008-9-19,It's a strong film but in the end a rather obvious one.
Die Welle,David Edwards,Daily Mirror (UK),8.0,2008-9-19,Thought-provoking stuff.
Die Welle,Carmen Gray,Total Film,6.0,2008-9-19,"A seductive, button-nudging probe of pack-frenzy mentality. Some credibility's lost in the rush to combustion point, but the brawny direction and convincing cast make this a gripping cautionary tale."
Die Welle,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,2.0,2008-9-19,Here is the winner of this week's No Shit Sherlock award: a prime example of the kind of film dead set on telling you what you know already.
Die Welle,Wendy Ide,Times (UK),4.0,2008-9-19,"It's an interesting and provocative idea somewhat marred by wretched performances from several of the kids and the same whiff of sanctimony and naivety that made The Edukators, another tiresomely right-on film from Germany, such a trial."
Die Welle,Jamie McLeish,Film4,5.0,2008-9-19,"An intriguing premise, well performed by the actors and engagingly directed by Gansel, suffers from a script that tries to pack too much into a single week and an ending that feels forced and didactic."
Die Welle,Trevor Johnston,Time Out,5.0,2008-9-19,"Still, the quicksilver editing and thumping score mean it's zippily put together, and an undeniable willingness to engage with a youthful audience is admirably inclusive."
Die Welle,Rosamund Witcher,Empire Magazine,8.0,2008-9-19,"A fascinating notion, convincingly realised."
Die Welle,Victor Olliver,Teletext,6.0,2008-9-18,The film is persuasive that fascism can take root in any environment. Strong performances all the way.
The Blind Side,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,5.0,2023-8-30,Hancock’s movie feels like an overly schmaltzy Disney production. All the realism of the story has been replaced by heavy sentimentality and scenes that play to audience expectations.
The Blind Side,Richard Crouse,Richard Crouse,7.0,2021-1-31,"There's too much emotional manipulation and huge problems seem to get solved a little too easily for it to be 100 percent believable, but it is an entertaining movie anchored by two very good, but very different actors."
The Blind Side,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,6.0,2020-11-28,"The plot of uncommon human kindness and charity is a formula for box office success and reasonable entertainment, but the execution is incredibly conventional."
The Blind Side,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,7.5,2020-9-3,The Blind Side is that rare formulaic flick that actually works.
The Blind Side,Tom Meek,Cambridge Day,7.5,2020-5-11,"Issues of race and racism are not left on the side, though, and the onscreen chemistry that [Sandra] Bullock and [Quinton] Aaron score is a game winner from the get-go."
The Blind Side,Kate Rodger,Newshub (NZ),5.0,2019-9-11,It felt tired and clichéd and the frequent and obvious emotional button-pushing failed to ignite any real response from me.
The Blind Side,Brigit Grant,Daily Express (UK),6.0,2017-8-23,"[It] is all about the family's altruism and turns a blind eye to silent Michael, with father Sean offering up the excuse: ""Michael's gift is his ability to forget."" I'm not convinced but that didn't stop me from enjoying the film and admiring Bullock."
The Blind Side,Perry Seibert,TV Guide,6.25,2014-1-24,The movie is very familiar -- you've seen it all before -- but it succeeds at achieving its modest goals.
The Blind Side,Kevin Carr,7M Pictures,6.0,2012-7-21,"Serves its purpose by making the audience tear up in some moments and cheer in others. It's a total button-pusher, but it does so in a very good way."
The Blind Side,Neil Pond,American Profile,6.0,2011-9-30,"Football may the thread that runs throughout, but the movie is much more interested in the tale of how Oher left behind a life of poverty, violence and foster-home despair to become a champ on the gridiron."
The Blind Side,Burl Burlingame,Honolulu Star-Advertiser,6.25,2011-7-5,"A living tribute to fundamental Christian motivations, although the point is hammered home with an extraordinarily soft touch: Love thy neighbor."
The Blind Side,Dave White,Movies.com,9.0,2011-4-4,You're going to be crying by the end.
The Blind Side,Mike Edwards,What Culture,1.0,2011-2-3,"Sing it together with me my brothers, thank the Lawd for he created the white man that he might teach them po' negroes the value of good Christian chariddy."
Seven Pounds,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,7.0,2020-11-28,"Employs a mixed tactic of misdirection and a little confusion, as the film jumps around on the timeline and waits to provide an explanation until almost halfway through."
Seven Pounds,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,7.5,2020-9-22,It was truly Rosario Dawson who completely enchanted me.
Seven Pounds,Nikki Baughan,Roll Credits,8.0,2019-10-30,"Seven Pounds becomes a mesmerising, powerful piece of film-making that, although not completely perfect... has the courage of its convictions to the end."
Seven Pounds,Mattie Lucas,From the Front Row,5.0,2019-7-7,Chokes on its own muddled spiritual regurgitation.
Seven Pounds,Kaleem Aftab,The List,4.0,2018-11-4,"The reason for the protagonist's actions is so ludicrous that the film's distributors asked critics not to reveal 'the twist'. Unsurprisingly, it's not worth knowing."
Seven Pounds,Simon Miraudo,Quickflix,3.0,2014-10-21,I've never seen such a bad film so well made.
Seven Pounds,Ben Kenigsberg,Time Out,4.0,2011-11-18,
Seven Pounds,Simon Reynolds,Digital Spy,4.0,2011-7-14,"An overwrought, improbable drama that's as frustrating as it is morbid."
Seven Pounds,Nick Rogers,Midwest Film Journal,0.0,2010-10-31,"Proof that no black actor, regardless of acclaim or popularity, can ever truly transcend the Mythical Black Man motif. Milquetoast dweebishness robs Will Smith of his natural forcefulness, and ""Seven Pounds"" has easily the worst ending of the last decade."
Seven Pounds,Luis Martinez,Cinenganos,4.0,2010-3-11,"El ritmo de la cinta es algo lento en un inicio pero después mejora, aunque hay que decirlo, se siente la mano manipuladora del director que parece haber estado más concentrado en pensar si el público se sentiría conmovido que en hacer un filme memorable."
Seven Pounds,Pete Hammond,Hollywood.com,9.0,2009-9-8,Seven Pounds may be the most spiritual picture of the holiday season; this story of redemption is a gift for moviegoers.
Seven Pounds,Sonny Bunch,Washington Times,6.25,2009-8-30,"The ending will divide viewers. Some will shed tears, others will be outraged. It's a bold artistic choice, but one of questionable morality."
Seven Pounds,Anders Wotzke,Moviedex,4.0,2009-7-30,Takes immense pleasure in letting its audience in on nothing.
Seven Pounds,Betsy Sherman,Boston Phoenix,3.75,2009-4-23,"Will Smith's previous film with director Gabriele Muccino, The Pursuit of Happyness, was a tale well told. Their new one is a gimmicky tale annoyingly told."
Eastern Promises,Stephen Silver,Tilt Magazine,8.0,2022-9-19,"Represented one of Cronenberg’s stronger periods, one with more mainstream success than the director has typically enjoyed. (15th anniversary)"
Eastern Promises,Fico Cangiano,CineXpress Podcast,8.0,2022-5-18,"Viggo Mortensen gives a fascinating performance in this dark and violent journey full of secrets, fidelity and family. [Full review in Spanish]"
Eastern Promises,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-4-4,"Beyond the film's eroticized violence and secretive world among the brutal Russian gangsters, Cronenberg also tells an immigrant story about people who want a better life only to find their desire exploited."
Eastern Promises,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,7.5,2022-4-1,"Full of whispery menace, marked by probing studies of masculinity at its extreme boundaries, punctuated with bursts of sexual and violent excess, and coping with an abrupt ending."
Eastern Promises,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,8.0,2020-11-24,The dark and brooding world of the Russian Mafia makes for thrilling movie material - and the jumping point for a contemporary gangster epic.
Eastern Promises,Mattie Lucas,"The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)",8.75,2019-6-5,"An intricate and mesmerizing thriller, featuring stellar performances (especially by Mortensen, who gives the bravest performance of his career) and an excellent script by Steven Knight"
Eastern Promises,Ben Rawson-Jones,Digital Spy,10.0,2011-7-14,"Quite possibly the best film of the year, it is to be seen at all costs."
Eastern Promises,Nick Rogers,Midwest Film Journal,10.0,2010-9-25,"David Cronenberg's spin on ""The Departed,"" in which lawmen and the lawless were similarly tested within an ethnic mafia's ranks. But where that became an overwrought bloodbath, ""Promises"" maintained a vicious focus on mob malevolence and personal peril."
Eastern Promises,Matthew Pejkovic,Matt's Movie Reviews,8.0,2010-7-6,"A captivating and intimidating presence, Mortenson is simply striking in his consecutive Cronenberg film, playing the slick Russian mob figure who suffers from a crisis of conscience with equal parts calm and intensity."
Eastern Promises,Ian Buckwalter,DCist,8.5,2010-6-10,"Clearly a companion piece to (and just as good as, if not better than) 2005's fantastic A History of Violence, Eastern Promises is all about blood, in the familial as well as the literal sense."
Eastern Promises,Mike Scott,Times-Picayune,6.25,2009-10-23,"Even if the frequently low-key plot suffers from the occasional sleepy stretch, Mortensen turns in a magnificent performance."
Eastern Promises,Tony Macklin,Fayetteville Free Weekly,6.0,2009-2-2,David Cronenberg is a director who sets out to bring life (and death) back to violence. In Eastern Promises he does just that. It is a movie that will make audiences squirm and look away.
Eastern Promises,Jeff Vice,Deseret News (Salt Lake City),7.5,2008-10-18,"Mortensen is very convincing as Nikolai, and his Russian accent is impeccable."
Stardust,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,7.5,2023-8-6,...an erratically-paced yet mostly satisfying endeavor...
Stardust,Nicholas Oon,Maximum Hype (YouTube),7.5,2021-8-14,If you want to see something very heartwarming. Something very light. Something very humorous and...a lot of bright colors that pop...then Stardust is a movie for you.
Stardust,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,9.0,2020-11-28,Brings an emphatically welcome revisit to the science-fiction-infused fantasy subgenre.
Stardust,Nikki Baughan,Roll Credits,8.0,2019-10-25,"Bright, breezy and utterly charming."
Stardust,Leigh Paatsch,Herald Sun (Australia),7.0,2018-12-28,"This lively fantasy-comedy (from the same creative team that went on to give us the Kick-Ass and Kingsman movies!) gets better as it goes along, calling on a dryness of wit and slyness of spirit that brings to mind... The Princess Bride."
Stardust,Brandy McDonnell,The Oklahoman,8.75,2018-8-13,"The movie boasts a stellar cast, even in the smallest roles, and they play their parts with gusto. Stardust has a sense of whimsy and quirky humor missing from many fantasy hits."

Stardust,Jeff Bayer,The Scorecard Review,7.0,2008-3-3,There was just enough connection between Claire Danes and Charlie Cox that happily ever after is exactly what I wanted.
Stardust,Brandon Fibbs,Colorado Springs Gazette,7.0,2008-2-28,Stardust is nothing short of pure magic.
Stardust,Pablo Villaça,Cinema em Cena,8.0,2008-1-16,"Primo contemporâneo de A Princesa Prometida, o filme também traz referências óbvias a Macbeth e Rei Lear em sua agitada trama, revelando um senso de humor eficaz e com toques sombrios que o transformam em uma mais do que bem-vinda surpresa."
The Secret of Kells,Yasser Medina,Cinefilia,5.0,2020-9-17,"'The Secret of Kells' is an independent animated film that, in my opinion, has an imaginative visual style, as well as allusions to Irish mythology, but its narrative is as soft as the sheets of a century-old manuscript. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Secret of Kells,Mattie Lucas,From the Front Row,6.25,2019-8-5,Its skillful balancing act of paganism and Christianity in its evocation of medieval Celtic spirituality is both fascinating and enchanting.
The Secret of Kells,Brandy McDonnell,The Oklahoman,10.0,2018-8-13,"The rich colors, lavish designs and charming characters are capable of captivating even the most avid fans of computer animation."
The Secret of Kells,Josh Larsen,LarsenOnFilm,8.75,2013-9-5,"Very few animated films have had such a mesmerizing, puzzle-like quality."
The Secret of Kells,David Keyes,Cinemaphile.org,10.0,2013-8-29,This is perhaps the most enchanting and zealous animated endeavor you will see this side of the Pixar lineup.
The Secret of Kells,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,5.0,2011-3-19,...there's never a point at which the viewer is wholeheartedly drawn into the admittedly simple narrative.
The Secret of Kells,Allan Hunter,Daily Express (UK),6.0,2010-10-11,"Steeped in both magic and mythology, The Secret Of Kells offers a refreshing alternative to Hollywood fare."
The Secret of Kells,Sophie Ivan,Film4,10.0,2010-10-6,"Combining a classic fairytale trajectory with a singular aesthetic that fuses Celtic and Christian mythology, this stunning film is yet another example of the rude health of contemporary animation."
The Secret of Kells,Derek Malcolm,London Evening Standard,6.0,2010-10-6,"Tomm Moore's Irish animation, drawn with painstaking reference to both Celtic myth and medieval manuscripts, possesses a lively originality that shows Europe's animators not far behind America's and in some ways in front of them."
The Secret of Kells,Alistair Harkness,Scotsman,8.0,2010-10-4,"This understated Irish charmer deserves to reach a wider audience, if only to remind people that animation is a diverse medium that can be exploited in numerous ways to tell all sorts of stories."
The Secret of Kells,Ellen E Jones,Total Film,8.0,2010-9-30,"Hand-drawn and watercoloured, the animation is as sublime as a stained-glass window."
The Secret of Kells,Marc Lee,Daily Telegraph (UK),8.0,2010-9-30,The look of the film is simply ravishing.
The Secret of Kells,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,6.0,2010-9-30,A low-key pleasure.
The Secret of Kells,Alice Levick,Little White Lies,8.0,2010-9-30,A feast for the eyes that manages to be both whimsical and sinister.
The Secret of Kells,David Parkinson,Radio Times,6.0,2010-9-30,"While this is a handsome picture that laudably avoids patronising its audience, it's not always as child-friendly as it might be."
The Secret of Kells,Helen O'Hara,Empire Magazine,10.0,2010-9-29,"Unlike anything else you've seen, and very much worth seeking out, this is a unique and beautiful creation."
The Secret of Kells,Cath Clarke,Time Out,8.0,2010-9-29,"The story is a bit tangled, and there is too much of it packed into nearly 80 minutes, but little kids won't be bothered when the animation is so magical."
Inside Man,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,8.0,2022-8-22,A straight-forward but enthralling caper that does right by its characters while offering Lee the wiggle room to poke at a few social issues along the way.
Inside Man,Leigh Paatsch,Herald Sun (Australia),9.0,2020-7-31,The best of its kind since The Usual Suspects.
Inside Man,Tom Meek,Cambridge Day,7.5,2020-6-29,"The interweaving of backstory and some taut subplots deepen the action, orchestrated with such precision that each scene innately ratchets up the stakes from its previous frame."
Inside Man,Michael Kleinschrodt,Times-Picayune,8.75,2019-5-30,Director Spike Lee's most polished effort in years is a gripping thriller with strong performances.
Inside Man,Joshua Starnes,ComingSoon.net,6.0,2011-3-27,"The lack of characterization of the robbers, while true to the structure of the story, makes it seem a bit flat. At the end of the day, it's not really about anything; it's just a bunch of stuff that happens. But it's a bunch of stuff that's fun to watch."
Inside Man,Nick Rogers,Midwest Film Journal,10.0,2010-9-24,"An intelligent, invigoratingly airtight caper and a love letter to New York on crumpled, coffee-stained paper, ""Inside Man"" is the best kind of Spike Lee joint - one where he doesn't stumble over his sledgehammer before swinging it."
Gone Baby Gone,Ezequiel Obregón,EscribiendoCine,8.0,2023-12-27,"As it goes from a classic detective story to a moral fable, the movie gains intensity. [Full review in Spanish]"
Gone Baby Gone,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2023-4-2,An affecting morality play that leaves us pondering the movie for days.
Gone Baby Gone,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,7.0,2020-11-24,What it lacks in catharsis it makes up for in gritty realism and tense moral struggles.
Gone Baby Gone,Mattie Lucas,From the Front Row,8.75,2019-7-6,"Ben Affleck has proven himself to be a skilled director, here's hoping this is a harbinger of great things to come."
Gone Baby Gone,David N. Butterworth,rec.arts.movies.reviews,8.75,2015-9-5,An out-and-out triumph for the Brothers Affleck.

Gone Baby Gone,Joshua Rothkopf,Time Out,8.0,2011-11-17,
Gone Baby Gone,Simon Reynolds,Digital Spy,8.0,2011-7-14,"As an actor, Ben Affleck might be a supporting player trapped in a leading man's body, but as a filmmaker he's an auspicious talent."
Gone Baby Gone,Dave White,Movies.com,9.0,2011-4-4,"Because it mostly succeeds, now that [Affleck's] got this and that good under-seen performance in Hollywoodland under his belt, he can hold his head high again."
Gone Baby Gone,Joshua Starnes,ComingSoon.net,8.0,2011-3-22,"A tense meditation on morality in the modern world, Gone Baby Gone is a superb crime thriller featuring a star performance from Casey Affleck. If crime drama is your thing, it really doesn't get much better than this."
Gone Baby Gone,Kevin Carr,7M Pictures,7.0,2008-8-18,"Affleck proved that his Good Will Hunting moment wasn't an aberration, and he also showed that he didn't need Matt Damon in tow to make a great movie."
La Vie En Rose,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,8.0,2022-8-23,The life of Edith Piaf was filled personal highs and devastating lows. “La Vie en rose” shows it to us through it’s truly enthralling and heart-breaking presentation.
La Vie En Rose,Leigh Paatsch,Herald Sun (Australia),8.0,2020-5-12,"A thoroughly gruelling, yet highly engrossing biopic of the legendary French singer Edith Piaf."
La Vie En Rose,Mattie Lucas,"The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)",8.75,2019-6-6,"In La Vie En Rose,we get to witness a rare and beautiful thing - an artist baring her soul and creating a performance for the ages."

La Vie En Rose,Karina Montgomery,Cinerina,8.0,2008-7-17,"Marion Cotillard's Oscar win? Totally justified...Many questions remain for those of us unschooled in Piaf lore. I was confused by some of the causes even as I felt the emotional effects, thanks to deep performances."
La Vie En Rose,Wesley Lovell,Cinema Sight,7.5,2008-7-13,"Much like the colorful life of the film's subject, La Vie en Rose explores the strange and emotional life of torch singer Edith Piaf and gives Marion Cotillard an Oscar for her tremendous performance."
La Vie En Rose,Brandon Fibbs,Colorado Springs Gazette,7.0,2008-2-28,Cotillard joins Ben Kingsley (Gandhi) and Forest Whitaker (The Last King of Scotland) in so completely embodying a role that it seems more possession than performance.
La Vie En Rose,Andrea Chase,Killer Movie Reviews,10.0,2008-2-24,"Here is what made the woman tick, if you need facts, find them in a book, if you want to understand her soul, see this film"
La Vie En Rose,Pablo Villaça,Cinema em Cena,6.0,2008-1-16,"Acaba funcionando mais como atestado do talento de sua protagonista, Marion Cotillard, do que como um tributo digno da magnífica cantora que esta interpreta."
The Illusionist,Keith Uhlich,Time Out,8.0,2023-5-25,"Does ample justice to the many layers of Jacques Tati’s tale, both in text and out."
The Illusionist,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,9.0,2022-8-22,It's not just the themes that resemble a Tati picture. Chomet and company go even further to make this feel like a movie that could slide right into Jacques Tati's catalog.
The Illusionist,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,10.0,2020-11-30,"Perfectly combines the unique visual style of Oscar-nominated animator Sylvain Chomet with the melancholy, simple, and poignant storytelling approach of Jacques Tati."
The Illusionist,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,8.75,2020-9-11,The Illusionist changed me in ways big and small and I am better for having seen it.
The Illusionist,Sarah Knight Adamson,Sarah's Backstage Pass,10.0,2020-1-16,"The film's animation tells the story, in the manner of a beautifully-illustrated children's storybook."
The Illusionist,Stephen Leach,CineVue,10.0,2018-11-5,"Chomet has delivered yet another fantastically assured film, one which even transcends the brilliance of his first feature."
300,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,3.0,2024-3-8,"300 claims some impressive visuals, but the narrow-mindedness of the plot and the childishness of the writing made this film hugely disappointing."
300,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,8.0,2020-11-24,Stylized violence at its finest.
300,Andrew Pollard,Starburst,8.0,2020-10-19,"If you're looking to see the rich, deep imagery of 300 play out in the most beautiful, bone-crunching way possible, this 4K offering is absolutely a must-have."
300,Allison Rose,FlickDirect,9.0,2020-10-8,Butler encompasses the demeanor of a mighty and powerful king/warrior whom men would follow into battle.

300,Mattie Lucas,"The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)",7.5,2019-6-6,"By no means great art, but it most certainly is fantastic trash."
300,Sarah Cartland,Caution Spoilers,8.0,2018-11-19,"A highly stylised fantasy, its colour palette both lush and gloomy. Leonidas is inspiring and practical and as usual when Butler's playing someone who isn't from Scotland, 50% Scottish. Headey is terrific, put her in charge of the Ancient World right now."
300,James Vance,Tulsa World,6.25,2018-2-6,"If you're in the mood for dumb, rousing, visceral excitement, you're not going to find anything on the big screen right now to rival it."
300,Hannah Brown,Jerusalem Post,7.5,2016-3-22,"There is an intelligent movie to be made about Spartan warrior culture, but 300 is not it. It is a fun ride, though, as long as you don't see it on a full stomach."
300,David Keyes,Cinemaphile.org,7.5,2013-9-13,Our instinctual desire to sneer at the implausibility of the story is stalled by a sense of ambition that seems unmatched even by the standards of the Hollywood assembly line.
300,Ali Gray,TheShiznit.co.uk,8.0,2012-11-3,So manly it makes Troy look like a Mary-Kate and Ashley adventure.
300,Ben Kenigsberg,Time Out Chicago,4.0,2012-7-9,"Wallowing in the same adolescent nihilism as his Sin City, this adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel suffers from a similar lack of momentum."
300,Coco Forsythe,Future Movies UK,7.0,2010-7-6,"As the first blockbuster of the year, 300 sets the bar high enough, and is enjoyably silly."
300,Scott Huver,Hollywood.com,8.0,2010-7-6,Visually thrilling and viscerally satisfying.
Match Point,Leigh Paatsch,Herald Sun (Australia),8.0,2020-5-5,"A mesmerising mix of moral drama and dark humour, with a shock ending to die for."
Match Point,Mattie Lucas,"The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)",7.5,2019-6-5,A finely tuned comeback worth celebrating.
Match Point,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,7.5,2016-4-7,...one of the venerable writer/director's more accomplished efforts in this new century.
Match Point,Tony Macklin,tonymacklin.net,8.0,2013-9-14,"But, perhaps, the greatest parallel between Woody's Match Point and Hitch is duality. It's a brilliant device."
Match Point,Nick Rogers,Midwest Film Journal,10.0,2010-9-19,"This lean, mean, surprisingly sultry thriller about fate, luck, greed and guilt is Woody Allen's best since ""Mighty Aphrodite."" Plus, it boasts a vintage-Allen metaphor of a bobbling tennis ball that, in a great gotcha scene, becomes a damning motif."
Match Point,Jay Antani,Cinema Writer,7.5,2010-8-19,"There's no ground here that Allen hasn't gone over before, but as a treatment of upper crust mores and, eventually, as a thriller, it's compulsively watchable and generally well acted."
Match Point,Brandon Fibbs,BrandonFibbs.com,8.0,2008-2-28,"Just when you were about to give up on Woody Allen, he reinvents himself with a taut tour de force of a film that is unquestionably the best thing he's done in decades."
Match Point,Joe Lozito,Big Picture Big Sound,7.5,2007-7-14,
Match Point,Kam Williams,Upstage Magazine,7.5,2007-5-25,"Proves to be an intriguing enough adventure, provided you haven't seen Crimes and Misdemeanors and don't mind rooting for a despicable, amoral philanderer."
Watchmen,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,6.25,2023-9-5,Ambitious films like this are generally either glorious artistic successes or utter failures; Watchmen uniquely falls somewhere in the middle.
Watchmen,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,7.0,2022-8-17,"While Snyder has brought this “unfilmable” story to the screen in the best way imaginable, he still can’t entirely keep it from feeling a bit cramped even at 160 minutes."
Watchmen,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,8.0,2020-11-29,There's no shortage of nudity and graphic bloodshed as the fate of the world rests on the shoulders of psychopaths.
Watchmen,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,6.25,2020-9-26,Better than expected but too often falling short.
Watchmen,Nikki Baughan,Roll Credits,10.0,2019-11-4,"The essence of what made [Alan] Moore's tale a work of genius is up on the screen for all to see, and it looks phenomenal."
Watchmen,Kate Rodger,Newshub (NZ),8.0,2019-8-29,"The world is ready for Watchmen, and I'll certainly be lining up to watch the Watchmen again."
Watchmen,Matthew Rozsa,Salon.com,8.75,2019-7-23,"When given a great story and told that his job is to simply adapt it, Snyder more than rises to the occasion."
Watchmen,Mattie Lucas,"The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)",3.75,2019-6-6,"[An] obnoxious, bloated, ghastly piece of brightly colored pop trash."
Watchmen,Kaleem Aftab,The List,6.0,2018-11-4,"Even with [its] failings, Watchmen is still atmospheric and entertaining."
Watchmen,Aaron Asadi,SciFiNow,4.0,2017-9-8,"[Zack] Snyder's Watchmen is mechanical, heartless and, tragically, hollow."
Lord of War,Michael Clark,Epoch Times,9.0,2023-10-16,"Yuri is Mr. Niccol’s Michael Corleone from “The Godfather” trilogy (directed by Mr. Cage’s uncle Francis Ford Coppola). Both Yuri and Michael put “family” first with their words, but make them last with their deeds."
Lord of War,Allison Rose,FlickDirect,8.0,2023-6-6,"Cage has the bravado to pull off the role of the cocky dealer going toe to toe with rival dealers and dictators, not to mention Interpol."
Lord of War,Kaleem Aftab,The List,8.0,2019-4-27,Lord of War is the most intelligent action film to come out of Hollywood since David O. Russell's Three Kings.
Lord of War,Nick Rogers,Midwest Film Journal,8.75,2010-9-19,"A carefully choreographed devil's dance in which Nicolas Cage finds fleet-footed rejuvenation as a man aware evil can't exist without good, but that evil often wins. This uniquely unsympathetic, world-weary film earns the right to fling that truth."
Lord of War,Joe Lozito,Big Picture Big Sound,6.25,2007-7-14,I'm beginning to get discouraged about Andrew Niccol.
Lord of War,Kam Williams,Upstage Magazine,0.0,2007-5-26,This film fails so miserably don't be surprised to find yourself often rooting against the supposed good guy.
Lord of War,Lisa Ann Cockrel,Christianity Today,7.5,2006-9-27,"Lord of War has a surreal edge, despite being enmeshed in world events, with absurdity and dark humor laced throughout."
Lord of War,Enrique Buchichio,Uruguay Total,4.0,2006-9-13,"Una pelcula frvola y superficial sobre un tema serio e importante como el trfico de armas. Entretiene, pero como denuncia cnica se queda corta."
Lord of War,Jim Lane,Sacramento News & Review,6.0,2006-5-12,"The movie's too flippant for good drama and not funny enough for satire, but the morbidly fascinating subject and Cage's reptilian performance hold our interest."
Lord of War,Kim Newman,Empire Magazine,6.0,2006-4-1,"Impressive performances, fascinating info-bytes and pertinent editorial, but in the end, it feels too much like an illustrated lecture."
Saw,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,5.0,2023-10-11,"The filmmakers try desperately to concoct a puzzle with a grand design, but there’s none to be found. Just a lot of flashbacks and puzzle pieces that don’t form a full picture."
Saw,James Croot,Stuff.co.nz,9.0,2023-1-18,"Most definitely not for the faint-hearted, Saw comes with an additional, vital warning: Whatever you do, do not watch any of the far inferior sequels that it sparked."
Saw,Justin Brown,Medium Popcorn,4.0,2022-10-24,I don't think this is a good movie and the performances in this were very uneven. It didn't seem as groundbreaking as it's known for.
Saw,Brandon Collins,Medium Popcorn,2.0,2022-10-24,There was nothing remotely entertaining about this film for me. Jigsaw's logic is completely insane and when you consider how much time it took for him to plan these schemes...it gets wonky very quickly.
Saw,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,4.0,2022-8-25,"It’s a far cry from the ridiculous gore-soaked torturefest the franchise has since become, but it still isn’t particularly good horror."
Saw,Trace Thurman,Horror Queers Podcast,8.0,2021-5-25,"While the torture porn moniker is more appropriate for the sequels that follow, Saw is a nasty piece of work with a compelling mystery at its center and an ending to die for."
Saw,Joe Lipsett,Horror Queers Podcast,7.0,2021-5-21,"Critically derided and unfairly slapped with the Torture Porn moniker, Saw is a reflection of post 9/11 anxieties, a bastion of low budget horror filmmaking and one of the few truly iconic franchises of the 00s. Get Jiggy with it"
Saw,Shaun Munro,Flickering Myth,7.0,2021-5-20,"The original Saw may be rough round the edges, but that unvarnished quality has a sure charm that its more cynical successors lack."
Saw,Gary Wolcott,Tri-City Herald,7.0,2014-10-31,The horror flick Saw started a chain-Saw of sequels and that is now one of the most successful of the chop-and-slash variety. It's not a bad way to spend a Halloween evening.
Mysterious Skin,Jordan M. Smith,IONCINEMA.com,9.0,2020-11-4,"Despite its prickly subject, Mysterious Skin, with its stellar young performances, gloriously original soundtrack and outstanding direction, is a film that begs for repeat viewings."
Mysterious Skin,Richard Propes,TheIndependentCritic.com,10.0,2020-9-17,The finest film of Gregg Araki's career.
Mysterious Skin,Paul Dale,The List,8.0,2019-4-24,The result is surprisingly in keeping with Araki's nihilistic talent and Heim's dreamlike fairytale narrative.
Mysterious Skin,PJ Nabarro,Patrick Nabarro,8.0,2019-2-1,"A seemingly impossible act of making an intelligent, literate drama about child abuse without being conventionally didactic."
Mysterious Skin,Noel Murray,The Dissolve,8.0,2014-3-17,"[...] For a movie about something as painful as child sexual abuse, Mysterious Skin doesn't repel. There's an allure to the images, which are as carefully posed and framed as figures in a softly illuminated dollhouse."
Mysterious Skin,Jay Antani,Cinema Writer,7.5,2010-8-21,"a bizarre, beguiling coming-of-age drama"

21 Grams,Matthew Pejkovic,Matt's Movie Reviews,8.0,2010-7-6,"A highly emotional, thought provoking drama that easily lives up to the hype, 21 Grams is a film that has all of its bases covered: script, acting and direction."

Finding Neverland,Nikhat Kazmi,The Times of India,7.0,2020-2-28,It''s a simple lyrical film that celebrates the value of innocence in a world that seems to be fast losing out to cynicism and despair.
Finding Neverland,Paul Dale,The List,8.0,2019-4-22,"This is a pleasing, old-fashioned tearjerker and a half. Pack a couple of hankies."
Finding Neverland,Nell Minow,Common Sense Media,6.0,2010-12-24,"Not about Peter Pan, and not a kids' movie."
Finding Neverland,Felix Vasquez Jr.,Cinema Crazed,7.0,2009-4-29,"A heartfelt, beautiful film, and one of the best dramas I've seen in years."

Finding Neverland,Russ Breimeier,Christianity Today,8.75,2006-9-28,A charming and dramatic tearjerker that's sweet without resorting to syrup.
Finding Neverland,Anthony Quinn,Independent (UK),6.0,2005-12-6,A nicely played family entertainment with perhaps more mystery than it knows what to do with.
25th Hour,Taylor Baker,Drink in the Movies,8.8,2021-8-27,It seems Spike has the most to say with his camera when he has the least to do with the screenplay.
25th Hour,Tom Meek,Cambridge Day,8.75,2020-6-29,"Another un-Spike Spike Lee joint, and probably Lee's greatest film that doesn't deal head-on with the matter of race."
25th Hour,PJ Nabarro,Patrick Nabarro,6.0,2019-2-1,"This sprawling and ecletic work from Spike Lee has, in a sense, more going for it in the ragged fringes of its story than in its slightly awkward, pre-determined centre."
25th Hour,Tim Brayton,Alternate Ending,8.0,2017-8-19,Profoundly suffused with an aura of loss.
25th Hour,Kevin Carr,Fat Guys at the Movies,4.0,2016-1-10,there is still plenty of angst saturating the film

25th Hour,Kelly Kessler,Common Sense Media,8.0,2011-1-2,Engaging but violent drama. Not for kids.
25th Hour,Rob Humanick,Projection Booth,10.0,2010-9-7,Finds beauty in the silver linings and embodies the notion that we're stronger than we usually realize we can be.
25th Hour,Matthew Pejkovic,Matt's Movie Reviews,8.0,2010-7-6,"An under-rated gem, 25th Hour is a powerful story about how the decisions you make in your life, and who you make them with, can ultimately lead to your downfall."
25th Hour,Michael Dequina,TheMovieReport.com,8.75,2009-2-18,"Lee successfully, seamlessly marries his famously inventive visual style with more introspective material."

The Royal Tenenbaums,Mitchell Beaupre,Paste Magazine,8.0,2022-9-22,"A family who seemingly has it all, a large collection of parents, siblings, children all under the same roof, and yet every single one of them, even Royal, still feels like an outsider."
The Royal Tenenbaums,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,8.0,2022-8-25,"Whether it’s his reliable favorites such as Murray and the Wilsons, or others such as Paltrow, Glover, and Stiller, the characters are a key component to the film and the casting of each role is spot on."
The Royal Tenenbaums,James Croot,Stuff.co.nz,8.0,2022-1-12,"Using a superb, dead-pan voiceover by Alec Baldwin, director Anderson invites the audience into the lives and secrets of each of the Tenenbaums."
The Royal Tenenbaums,Stephen Silver,Tilt Magazine,10.0,2021-12-31,"Anderson's third film, and best overall, and one of my favorite movies of all time (20th anniversary)"
The Royal Tenenbaums,PJ Nabarro,Patrick Nabarro,8.0,2018-12-16,What really stands out is how rich the story's technical canvas and narrative textures actually are.
The Royal Tenenbaums,Christopher Machell,CineVue,10.0,2017-1-16,"With a stellar cast, gorgeous art direction and a surprisingly moving story [The Royal Tenenbaums is], a contender for Anderson's best work to date."
The Royal Tenenbaums,Jack Mathews,New York Daily News,8.75,2014-10-1,"This comedy-drama about a dysfunctional family of eccentric geniuses is exactly the kind of movie America could use. It's funny, poignant, laced with irresistibly flawed characters and focuses on the power of love in a family."
Blow,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,5.0,2020-9-25,"Although Depp has little range, he's acceptable in the lead - a source of calm and emotional steadiness, which contrasts the nervousness and paranoia of his associates."
Blow,M. Faust,Common Sense Media,6.0,2011-1-2,Uneven drug trade story has explicit drug use.
Blow,John J. Puccio,Movie Metropolis,5.0,2008-10-5,"Does the movie make us care? Not really, which is the movie's basic problem."
Blow,Joe Lozito,Big Picture Big Sound,6.25,2007-7-14,
Blow,Emanuel Levy,EmanuelLevy.Com,5.0,2006-4-29,"Rambling and confused, the film shows much concern for plot and not enough for characterization, particularly in second half which unfolds as a catalog of events. Misdirected, the usually reliable Depp gives a confused and scattered performance."
Blow,Alex Ramirez,Cinenganos,6.0,2005-2-20,"Tiene una edicin maravillosa, la fotografa es notable y la direccin bien lograda."
Blow,Jeffrey Westhoff,"Northwest Herald (Crystal Lake, IL)",7.5,2005-1-10,"A worthy companion to Traffic, which isn't all it's cracked up to be, either."

Enemy at the Gates,Michael Sragow,Baltimore Sun,7.5,2023-7-15,"Without its ambitious underpinnings, these virtuoso set pieces wouldn't flicker with emotion. In Enemy at the Gates, gravity has entertainment value, at least to those who can respond to wartime fervor."
Enemy at the Gates,Leigh Paatsch,Herald Sun (Australia),5.0,2020-10-2,"Time and time again, Enemy at the Gates squanders its pulse-pounding momentum on long, high-falutin' stretches of pointy-headed pretentiousness that just get in the road of the good stuff."
Enemy at the Gates,Nell Minow,Common Sense Media,8.0,2010-12-24,Tense and violent WWII movie.
Enemy at the Gates,Kevin Carr,7M Pictures,4.0,2010-1-9,it could have held back on the parts featuring boredom because they did tend to drag the suspense down a bit
Enemy at the Gates,Bob Grimm,Sacramento News & Review,4.0,2008-8-7,"There's a decent movie buried in here somewhere, but the lousy love triangle and ultimate lack of focus make this WWII drama a bit hard to take."
Enemy at the Gates,Harry Guerin,RTÉ (Ireland),6.0,2003-2-26,"Worth the trouble, but make sure to leave the history notes at home."
Enemy at the Gates,John R. McEwen,Film Quips Online,8.0,2003-2-8,"It generally succeeds at telling a truly heroic story, providing yet another vehicle to showcase the talents of Law and Harris, and of their supporting cast."
Minority Report,Jonathan Rosenbaum,Chicago Reader,7.5,2022-8-10,"Minority Report does offer a few issues to ponder, and given the mindlessness of most summer action specials, it’s something of an intellectual feast, even if it’s all hors d’oeuvres."
Minority Report,Victoria Luxford,BBC.com,10.0,2022-7-29,"Certainly one of Tom Cruise’s best (films), and I think one of Steven Spielberg’s best too…. So much fun to watch, a really intriguing thriller."
Minority Report,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,10.0,2022-3-20,The visionary quality of Minority Report's cinematic world is matched solely by its endless influence on both film and real-world technology since its release.
Minority Report,Fico Cangiano,CineXpress Podcast,8.0,2021-5-25,"An entertaining sci-fi ride that offers nifty visuals, interesting themes and of course Tom Cruise running and jumping all over futuristic set pieces. [Full review in Spanish]"
Minority Report,Danielle Solzman,Solzy at the Movies,9.0,2021-1-1,Minority Report leaves much to debate about the film's themes and the rightness or wrongness.
Minority Report,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,8.0,2020-11-7,"The level of fantasy frequently rivals the severer science-fiction elements, radiating Spielberg's brand of lively storytelling."
Minority Report,Christopher Lloyd,The Film Yap,8.0,2020-6-29,"Though it's not among the finest adaptations of Philip K. Dick, Minority Report has aged rather well with its prescient, paranoiac glimpse of the not-distant-enough future."
Minority Report,Namrata Joshi,Outlook,7.5,2019-1-3,"Spielberg creates an intriguing world that is at once futuristic and accessible, it makes our collective imagination soar but is never alienating."
Minority Report,Dennis King,Tulsa World,8.75,2016-6-15,"Even if he belabors the ending and can't resist tempering the darkness with a strained ray of hopefulness, Minority Report is a document that proves Spielberg among the top ranks in a minority of film geniuses."
Minority Report,Michael Sragow,Baltimore Sun,6.25,2013-8-5,"Too much of Minority Report is facile, albeit at a very high level."
American Psycho,Chuck Klosterman,Akron Beacon Journal,5.0,2023-10-28,"I will not give away the ending to American Psycho, but I will say this: The last three scenes are implausible and unnecessary (and totally unrelated to the book) and the ending includes the cheapest, most manipulative trick in filmmaking."
American Psycho,Justin Brown,Medium Popcorn,2.0,2022-10-9,"I couldn't connect with this movie at all. In a way, the story kind of goes nowhere. But at the same time, Christian Bale goes for broke and you can't help but appreciate it."
American Psycho,Brandon Collins,Medium Popcorn,4.0,2022-10-9,"Despite an incredible performance by Christian Bale, this movie was a struggle to get through given that none of the characters had any redeeming qualities."
American Psycho,Trace Thurman,Horror Queers Podcast,6.0,2020-12-30,"Expertly made and does what it's trying to do very well, but I just can't fully connect with this one."
American Psycho,PJ Nabarro,Patrick Nabarro,6.0,2020-6-24,The idea that this is all a fantasy inside Bateman's head is brilliantly realised in his growing realisation that he's been able to get away with all of this in plain sight.
American Psycho,Zoe Rose Smith,Zobo With A Shotgun,8.0,2019-10-27,"American Psycho is one of the greatest horror films of all time; with its disturbingly dark comedy, psychotic breakdowns of society and an unnerving look at the obsessive thoughts of a serial killer."
American Psycho,Jeffrey M. Anderson,Common Sense Media,6.0,2014-4-29,"A bloody, gruesome black comedy that's not for kids."
Mulan,Wesley Lovell,Cinema Sight,10.0,2022-11-26,"While inferior to both “Hunchback” and “Beauty and the Beast,” “Mulan” is a fun film, a exciting and breathtaking film that gives little girls a great role model and the strongest Disney heroin ever."
Mulan,Zoë Rose Bryant,Loud and Clear Reviews,10.0,2022-9-1,"Mulan was a revolutionary risk for Disney, but this ageless adventure still strikes a chord with audiences all these years later, as a flawless feminist fable that stands the test of time."
Mulan,Matt Roth,Chicago Reader,2.5,2022-6-16,Only when local cultural traditions die can Disney sell its brand of glossy nostalgia...
Mulan,Nicole Ackman,Next Best Picture,9.0,2021-1-30,What sets Mulan apart is that it is both one of the funniest and one of the darkest Disney films.
Mulan,Josh Larsen,LarsenOnFilm,6.25,2020-3-27,...the show tunes and sidekicks are largely unnecessary.
Mulan,Tim Brayton,Antagony & Ecstasy,7.0,2009-12-3,What is chiefly impressive is that the appropriation of Chinese iconography in a film that was plainly made by Western animators feels ultimately so natural and successful.
Mulan,Susan Stark,Detroit News,10.0,2008-10-18,
Mulan,Betsy Bozdech,DVDJournal.com,10.0,2006-10-22,"A good-hearted, entertaining movie that accomplishes its goals and scores a few 'girl power' points to boot, and it's definitely worthy of a spot on the family video shelf."
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,Christopher Kelly,Premiere Magazine,6.0,2023-2-14,Depp and Del Toro deliver deliciously overstuffed ham-sandwich performances that more than compensate for the film's fractured narrative. But the real star here is director Gilliam.
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,Leigh Paatsch,Herald Sun (Australia),4.0,2020-9-11,All you will learn is that the irksome excesses of early 1970s living were left behind for a very good reason. They just weren't that much fun at all.
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,Maitland McDonagh,TV Guide,6.25,2012-5-2,A peculiar and oddly haunting achievement.
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,Film4 Staff,Film4,5.0,2012-5-2,"Bizarre, unpredictable yet strangely alluring."
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,Josh Larsen,LarsenOnFilm,5.0,2011-10-31,The fear is comical; the loathing almost nonexistent.
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,R.L. Shaffer,IGN DVD,8.0,2011-5-16,"Certainly uneven at times, but Terry Gilliam's surreal mood piece paints a vivid, splashy picture of gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson."
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,Christopher Long,Movie Metropolis,9.0,2011-5-16,A beautiful cinematic showcase for Thompson at the peak of his writing skills.
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,Eric Melin,Kansas City Star,7.5,2011-5-1,"It may start off as a lighthearted, excess-filled, party-road-trip movie, but Depp is reigned in a little towards the end as his character (a stand-in for Thompson) poetically bemoans the sad failure of the late-60s ideals and values."
Dark City,Don Shanahan,Every Movie Has a Lesson,6.0,2024-4-7,Dark City deftly creates a world both foreign and familiar at the same time to match the clouded tone of its story.
Dark City,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,7.5,2023-8-22,"This is an exceptionally stylish-looking production driving a story with grand aspirations, and though flawed, like the majority of Proyas’ work, it achieves most of what it sets out to do."
Dark City,Wesley Lovell,Cinema Sight,8.75,2023-1-18,"The other major item of note in the film is its visual effects. From a giant clock to a city changing before our eyes, Dark City is one of the most spectacular visual effects feats to come out in recent memory."
Dark City,Bill Boisvert,Chicago Reader,2.5,2022-6-16,Real humanists may have misgivings.
Dark City,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,6.0,2020-9-11,"Trying for a modernized film noir mixed with gothic science-fiction, the film is a striking blend of genres and motifs."
Dark City,Mike Clark,USA Today,7.5,2018-1-9,"Dark City is fascinating, visionary filmmaking that captures the sensation of dreaming and being unable to wake up."
Dark City,Michael Dequina,TheMovieReport.com,7.5,2009-3-31,A visionary slice of visceral experience.
Dark City,Peter Canavese,Groucho Reviews,8.75,2008-8-5,Proyas assembles his inspirations into a unique amalgam with the power of myth to tap the fears and desires of our collective unconscious. [Blu-Ray]

Dark City,Jules Brenner,Cinema Signals,10.0,2008-7-25,"In the annals of noir Sci-Fi, by any measure, this is a Classic of cinematic invention."
Dark City,John J. Puccio,Movie Metropolis,8.0,2008-7-25,"...the movie is mostly style, but it's a style so engrossing, it more than makes up for any lack of substance."
Lost Highway,Yasser Medina,Cinefilia,7.0,2022-7-25,"It travels, without deviating, through the darkest labyrinthine highways of alienation, sex and murder, in which the most unexpected situations of domestic horror are parked on the road as an act of surreal escape. [Full review in Spanish]"
Lost Highway,Nicholas Bell,IONCINEMA.com,8.0,2022-6-24,"Justifiably off-putting in its simple but nonetheless jarring narrative disorientation, Lost Highway is hardly the empty, superficial exercise it was written off as."
Lost Highway,Grant Watson,Fiction Machine,8.0,2020-7-24,"Senses of unease and menace are soaked into every scene. It is genuinely disturbing in places, adding up to an overall frightening experience that tops close to every horror work of its decade."
Lost Highway,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,6.25,2019-6-23,A prototypically baffling David Lynch picture...
Lost Highway,Sarah Wenk,Common Sense Media,4.0,2011-1-2,"Strange, disjointed; full of sex and violence."
Dead Man,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,7.5,2021-8-29,"Part revisionist Western, part social commentary, and part hallucinatory dream."
Dead Man,Nathanael Hood,The Retro Set,9.0,2018-12-29,"If not the best American Western of the 1990s, then certainly the most original and unusual."
Dead Man,James Berardinelli,ReelViews,6.25,2018-11-9,"Even if it accomplishes little else, Dead Man will almost certainly inspire thought and discussion."
Dead Man,Edward Guthmann,San Francisco Chronicle,7.5,2018-11-9,"[The] metaphysical context benefits enormously from the haunting musical themes that Neil Young wrote, underlining the film's psychedelic/apocalyptic edge, and from the stunning black-and-white camera work of Robby Muller."
Dead Man,Robert Roten,Laramie Movie Scope,4.0,2018-11-9,"In this movie, Jarmusch displays an uncanny knack of having absolutely nothing happening on the screen for long periods of time, fading to black, and then coming back with still more nothing."
Dead Man,Chris Hicks,Deseret News (Salt Lake City),5.0,2018-11-9,Dead Man is surprisingly bland. And it becomes more dull -- and more grotesque -- as it moves along.
Dead Man,Roger Ebert,Chicago Sun-Times,3.75,2018-11-9,"Dead Man is a strange, slow, unrewarding movie that provides us with more time to think about its meaning than with meaning."
Dead Man,Marc Savlov,Austin Chronicle,5.0,2018-11-9,"Beautifully shot in high contrast black-and-white, Dead Man fails not because of any one particular flaw, but instead stumbles, caught in a quagmire of metaphysical constructs and Western lore."

Apollo 13,James Croot,Stuff.co.nz,10.0,2022-7-29,"Howard’s movie heartrendingly brings that idea to life by focusing not only the men on the mission, but the families and colleagues they left behind."
Apollo 13,Rene Rodriguez,Miami Herald,6.25,2021-8-18,"Apollo 13 captures the wonder of space travel with the wide-eyed zeal of a 10-year-old: They really were heroes, these guys, and the movie shows you why."
Apollo 13,Danielle Solzman,Solzy at the Movies,10.0,2020-6-30,...Apollo 13 is a cinematic masterpiece...
Apollo 13,Leigh Paatsch,Herald Sun (Australia),8.0,2020-6-6,[A] compelling look back at the most action-packed American space mission of all time.
Apollo 13,Mark Jackson,Epoch Times,8.0,2020-5-17,"This film is a tribute to the all-American values of tenacity, teamwork, ingenuity, and--as is the case for all teams on dangerous missions--selflessness and brotherhood."
Apollo 13,Dave Kehr,New York Daily News,7.5,2014-8-22,"Tom Hanks is on his way to becoming the American Everyman, an exemplar of boyish goodwill and quiet moral force."
Apollo 13,Doug Thomas,Seattle Times,8.75,2014-8-22,Ron Howard's pop-entertainment you-are-there space thriller is easily the most rousing film of the year. And it might make real spaceflight just as nifty as Star Wars for youngsters.
Apollo 13,Adrian Turner,Radio Times,8.0,2013-7-30,"Partially filmed in genuine weightless conditions, Ron Howard's movie is a technical tour de force."
Apollo 13,Jay Boyar,Orlando Sentinel,8.0,2013-7-30,Hanks is a terrific choice for the lead because he can appear strong and military without slipping over into Sgt. Rock corniness.
Apollo 13,Michael Wilmington,Chicago Tribune,10.0,2013-7-30,"Apollo 13, one of the most exciting adventure movies of the year, proves that science history can be just as thrilling as science fiction."
Falling Down,Mick LaSalle,San Francisco Chronicle,10.0,2023-1-11,"A brilliant drama with black-comic undertones. The film is directed by Joel Schumacher and stars Michael Douglas, in what may be the best performance of his career,"

Falling Down,Tom Meek,Cambridge Day,7.5,2020-7-8,"This is probably Schumacher's most accomplished work besides Tigerland and, interestingly, shot in L.A. around the time of the riots."
Falling Down,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,8.75,2018-12-6,It's a somewhat high-concept premise that's employed to consistently engrossing effect by filmmaker Schumacher...
Falling Down,Kevin Carr,7M Pictures,6.0,2010-1-10,The character of William Foster (simply called D-Fens in the closing credits) represents an element of our collective id.
Falling Down,Walter Chaw,Film Freak Central,2.5,2009-12-7,Atrociously written by actor Ebbe Roe Smith and atrociously directed (it goes without saying) by Joel Schumacher...
Falling Down,Peter Canavese,Groucho Reviews,7.5,2009-6-1,"A heavy-handed potboiler, but as it raises the temperature, it does give cause to consider the line--so easily crossed--between social function and disasterous personal undoing. [Blu-ray]"
Falling Down,John J. Puccio,Movie Metropolis,6.0,2009-5-24,"...holds up pretty well today, even if its tone meanders all over the place."
Falling Down,Steve Crum,Video-Reviewmaster.com,8.0,2008-2-24,"Maybe Michael Douglas' best work, he as the depressed man driven to madness."
Falling Down,Cole Smithey,ColeSmithey.com,8.0,2008-2-12,Joel Schumacher's best film.
Dazed and Confused,Peter Bradshaw,Guardian,10.0,2023-9-15,"It’s a strange film in many ways, affectless and directionless, coolly refusing the usual dramatic beats and climactic moments, and as unreflective as MOR rock."
Dazed and Confused,Josh Larsen,LarsenOnFilm,10.0,2023-9-14,...doubles as a treatise on the American experiment as a whole.
Dazed and Confused,Tom Meek,Cambridge Day,8.75,2020-8-21,"The magnum opus of Linklater's Austin films, but in this slice of life it's high schoolers moving up and moving on."
Dazed and Confused,Patrick McDonald,HollywoodChicago.com,10.0,2020-5-1,"Totally authentic. Every time you watch this film, you're taken back to the 1970s daze of high school. The '70s kids AMERICAN GRAFFITI."
Dazed and Confused,Fico Cangiano,CineXpress Podcast,7.0,2020-4-13,"Richard Linklater manages to entertain with a film that's really about nothing, yet truly works as a snapshot of a certain moment in time. [Full review in Spanish]"

Dazed and Confused,R.L. Shaffer,IGN DVD,9.0,2012-1-29,"The film transcends the common barriers and becomes a living spiritual entity, encompassing the essence and tone of an era."
My Cousin Vinny,Stephen Silver,Tilt Magazine,8.0,2022-3-19,"The film has been praised by lawyers as one of the more realistic movies about the justice system and the lawyer profession, and certainly one of the most successful ones at drawing humor from a courtroom setting (35th anniversary)"
My Cousin Vinny,Eddie Harrison,film-authority.com,6.0,2022-1-12,"...a minor gem of a movie, without pretention, but smart and clever in the way the narrative brings all sides together in the on-going search for justice...."

My Cousin Vinny,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,9.0,2020-9-16,"Thanks to director Lynn's own legal expertise, a level of authenticity amusingly lingers amidst the drama, clever personas, alluring storyline, and convivial performances."
My Cousin Vinny,Karl Delossantos,Smash Cut Reviews,8.0,2019-8-6,My Cousin Vinny proves that well-written and superbly delivered jokes belong in comedies.
My Cousin Vinny,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,7.5,2015-1-24,The undercurrent of fish-out-of-water silliness goes a long way towards perpetuating the affable atmosphere...
My Cousin Vinny,Dave Kehr,Chicago Tribune,7.5,2014-4-30,"With such canny scene-stealers as Gwynne, Smith, Pendleton, McGill and Chaykin filling out the cast, it is very hard for My Cousin Vinny to go wrong, and indeed, for the purpose of pleasant Saturday night entertainment, it does not."
My Cousin Vinny,Desmond Ryan,Philadelphia Inquirer,6.25,2014-4-30,"The movie sags as Vinny sets out to demolish the patently shaky case and dubious witnesses for the prosecution. Pesci does his best, but a lawyer's suit on him becomes a straitjacket."
My Cousin Vinny,Michael Upchurch,Seattle Times,7.5,2014-4-30,"The pacing is brisk and the energy of the performances is so palpable that even at its silliest and most contrived, the film is enjoyable."
My Cousin Vinny,Kevin Harley,Total Film,6.0,2014-4-30,"The regional stereotypes in Dale Launer's broad script aren't so laudable, but the on-screen talent merits a retrial: Tomei talks up a storm and Pesci terrorises thinly spread gags into near-shape."
My Cousin Vinny,Gary Thompson,Philadelphia Daily News,6.25,2014-4-30,"For all of its grossly stereotypical characterizations and cheap laughs, My Cousin Vinny does benefit from Pesci's characteristically energetic performance. And co-star Tomei looks very nice in a clinging blue dress with gold lame applique."
My Cousin Vinny,Stephen Hunter,Baltimore Sun,6.25,2014-4-30,I don't want to oversell My Cousin Vinny. It's hardly brilliant. But it's easygoing and occasionally quite funny and ultimately satisfying.
My Cousin Vinny,Jo Berry,Radio Times,8.0,2014-4-30,[An] enjoyable fish-out-of-water comedy.

Delicatessen,Iain Robertson,Starburst,8.0,2023-10-16,"While the subject matter is bleak, Delicatessen is a charming, unique movie and a truly unique piece of cinema."
Delicatessen,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,9.0,2020-9-11,"Thriving on eccentricity, the film also utilizes an artistic entwining of music and sound effects, tinged with a spectacularly compelling atmosphere of unease."
Delicatessen,Tim Brayton,Antagony & Ecstasy,9.0,2016-12-6,"If we take the idea of a romantic comedy set in the ruins of a dead society and dressed up with cannibal horror seriously at all, it's hard to see how it could turn out better than this."
Delicatessen,Stephen Hunter,Baltimore Sun,7.5,2013-11-21,"The movie, take it from me, is a lot more fun to sit through than to describe in a single sentence."
Delicatessen,David Parkinson,Radio Times,8.0,2013-11-21,"Bizarre, brilliant, but wayward in its dnouement."
Delicatessen,Steven Rea,Philadelphia Inquirer,8.75,2013-11-21,"With its molelike inhabitants, its sprawling war between flesh-eaters and lentil-men, its achingly sweet love story and surrealist blend of dusty antiquities and 21st-century gizmos, Delicatessen is indescribably wild."
Delicatessen,Clifford Terry,Chicago Tribune,8.75,2013-11-21,"All of this is handled in a breezy, off-handed, nutsy manner, as the superb cast combines to help bring it off."

Home Alone,Hal Lipper,Tampa Bay Times,6.0,2023-11-29,"Culkin is the perfect tufted tow-headed tyke; the human equivalent of the Roadrunner, his face twisting and eyes brightening with every revelation and idea. Pesci and Stern, accordingly, are cast as Wiley Coyotes."
Home Alone,Rob Lowing,The Sun-Herald (Australia),7.5,2023-11-29,"Home Alone is a cheerful, happy-minded comedy with clever casting and the kind of repetitious slapstick action to thrill the kids."
Home Alone,Bruce R. Miller,Sioux City Journal,7.5,2023-11-29,"Once Culkin is left to hos own devices, the film takes off. The last 45 minutes are achingly funny -- the perfect pre-Christmas present. Enjoy the laughs and don't leave anyone home alone. This is a picture the whole family can ejoy."
Home Alone,Barbara Shulgasser,San Francisco Examiner,6.25,2023-11-29,"The exception to the predictability is Kevin's plotted revenge against two extremely goofy criminals, played by the brilliant Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern."

Home Alone,Kathleen Carroll,New York Daily News,7.0,2023-11-29,"You may not buy the contrived plot, but this giddy, warm-hearted comedy will have both children and grownups giggling in the aisles."
Home Alone,Noel Taylor,Ottawa Citizen,4.0,2023-11-29,"Kevin learns some lessons, too. Families aren't bad after all. Families are nice. Being Home Alone isn't much fun. He's right."
Home Alone,Jay Boyar,Orlando Sentinel,7.5,2023-11-29,Writer/producer Hughes and director Chris Columbus have assembled a likeable cast led by Macaulay Culkin who plays Kevin and can make an impressive screaming face.
Home Alone,Terry Kelleher,Newsday,7.5,2023-11-29,"In the spirit of the coming season, you forgive this movie and cheerfully accept its gifts -- a few big laughs, several unforced chuckles, and a touching moment or two."

Lethal Weapon,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,8.0,2020-9-6,"An enduring buddy film, brilliantly combining drama, comedy, adventure, bloodshed, machine gun showdowns in the middle of busy highways, and excessive property destruction."
Lethal Weapon,Rachel Wagner,rachelsreviews.net,4.0,2020-5-25,My problem with Lethal Weapon is I did not love the script or the action
Lethal Weapon,David Nusair,Reel Film Reviews,7.5,2019-12-24,...it's not difficult to see why Riggs and Murtaugh became downright iconic figures after the release of this picture...
Lethal Weapon,Gene Siskel,Chicago Tribune,7.5,2014-12-13,"[Gibson and Glover] make a great team, and some of their early adventures are exciting. But the film runs out of gas as it turns into an extended chase sequence."
Lethal Weapon,Desmond Ryan,Philadelphia Inquirer,7.5,2013-12-6,"The story, which proceeds with inevitability, is enlivened by Donner's rousing action sequences."
Lethal Weapon,John Marriott,Radio Times,8.0,2013-12-6,"Implausibility is a large part of the entertainment in this romp par excellence, with each overblown set piece becoming ever more ludicrous."
Lethal Weapon,Roger Hurlburt,South Florida Sun-Sentinel,6.25,2013-5-13,"Nothing, however, can really prepare audiences for the generally good, though offbeat, performances, gritty action and serio-comic exploits of the Good Guys vs. the Bad Guys."
Lethal Weapon,Johanna Steinmetz,Chicago Tribune,1.25,2013-5-13,"As action-adventure, it's pointlessly puerile, a movie where the heroes are so childish they try to one-up each other with fancy shots at the pistol range."
Lethal Weapon,Walter Chaw,Film Freak Central,5.0,2012-8-12,What does it say that I loved it as a boy of fourteen?
Lethal Weapon,Matt Brunson,Creative Loafing,6.25,2012-6-14,"Yeah, I know, I know: It's considered an action classic and routinely pegged as one of the best ""buddy cop"" films, but it's always held just marginal appeal for me -- besides, compare it to Die Hard, and its ""classic"" status seems even more ludicrous."
Lethal Weapon,Elliot Panek,Common Sense Media,6.0,2011-1-1,Mismatched cops spar in violent '80s action hit.
Lethal Weapon,James Berardinelli,ReelViews,8.75,2009-7-7,"From a distance, Lethal Weapon might appear generic, but a closer look reveals something special."

Blood Simple,John Higgins,Starburst,8.0,2017-10-18,"The script is as tight as it ever was, keeping attention throughout and little clues and subtleties can easily be missed if you are not paying attention - this film demands focus from the very first frame."
Blood Simple,Simran Hans,Observer (UK),8.0,2017-10-8,"Blood Simple is a reminder that the Coens are formalist film-makers first, with keen noses for composition and taut, structured storytelling, as well as masters of black comedy."

The Muppet Movie,Angie Errigo,Radio Times,8.0,2017-9-6,Comedy director James Frawley imposes pleasing order on the charming proceedings while Henson and his long-time associate Frank Oz delightfully dominate.
The Muppet Movie,Roger Ebert,Chicago Sun-Times,8.75,2015-6-1,"Jolson sang, Barrymore spoke, Garbo laughed, and now Kermit the Frog rides a bicycle... If you can figure out how they were able to show Kermit pedaling across the screen, then you are less a romantic than I am: I prefer to believe he did it himself."
The Muppet Movie,Matt Brunson,Creative Loafing,8.75,2013-8-17,"As expected, Fozzie the Bear and the old geezers Statler and Waldorf receive the lion's share of the choice lines."
The Muppet Movie,James Kendrick,Q Network Film Desk,6.25,2013-8-15,"while The Muppet Movie is certainly entertaining, the shift to a coherent, linear, feature-length narrative deprives the film the show's brilliantly structured inanity"
The Muppet Movie,Noel Murray,The Dissolve,8.0,2013-8-13,"With his Muppets, Henson found a balance between fuzzy post-hippie positivism and self-deprecating wit, and he added in the same quality that made many of the era's cultural phenomena so charming: simple problem-solving."
The Muppet Movie,James Plath,Movie Metropolis,8.0,2013-8-2,"'The Muppet Movie' is one big road trip, and like 'The Blues Brothers' there's a payoff not just at the end, but around nearly every corner. Music only sweetens the deal."

Escape from Alcatraz,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,7.5,2023-3-27,"For an Eastwood vehicle, there’s very little action per se, but few will mind."

Escape from Alcatraz,Keith Garlington,Keith & the Movies,8.0,2022-8-20,"Siegel’s storytelling is as precise and methodical.....

Escape from Alcatraz,Roger Ebert,Chicago Sun-Times,8.75,2004-10-23,"It's one of those very difficult exercises in which large emotions, like the compulsion to be free, are reflected in minute actions, like the chipping away at stone with a pocket nail clipper."
Watership Down,Rachel Wagner,Rachel's Reviews (YouTube),8.0,2019-2-21,I love the book and I think... that this is a worthy adaptation.
Watership Down,J.C. Maçek III,PopMatters,7.0,2015-3-27,"Although this is an animated film featuring cute rabbits as the main characters, this is far from a children's movie, and considering the violence and horror to be found in this film, it is rather surprising that the MPAA passed it with a PG rating."
Watership Down,James Kendrick,Q Network Film Desk,8.75,2015-3-5,The film's careful balance of humanizing the rabbits while also recognizing the realities of their inherent nature (which is more territorial and combative than cute and cuddly) gives its conflict a particularly sharp edge
Watership Down,Matt Brunson,Creative Loafing,6.25,2015-3-4,The animation style veers between poetic and prosaic.
Watership Down,Austin Trunick,Under the Radar,8.5,2015-2-26,"A rather faithful adaptation of [Richard] Adams' book, as well as a milestone work of independent animation."

Watership Down,John J. Puccio,Movie Metropolis,6.0,2008-10-3,"...lovely to look at and fun to listen to, but dull and lethargic in spots, too, and sometimes brutally savage."
Watership Down,Richard Luck,Film4,8.0,2008-9-3,"A beautifully realised animation, Watership Down ultimately works because it doesn't dilute the violence and drama of Adams' book with a rose-tinted lens."
Watership Down,Steve Crum,Video-Reviewmaster.com,8.0,2008-2-17,"Artful, pretty forgotten (and it should not be) animation of best seller."

Midnight Express,James Kendrick,Q Network Film Desk,7.5,2009-7-22,a brutal and brutalizing film whose effects have diminished little in the decades since its controversial theatrical release in the late 1970s
Midnight Express,Peter Canavese,Groucho Reviews,7.5,2009-7-21,Strong stuff indeed...swells proportional sight and sound subjectively to convey Hayes' nightmarish experience but also hypes up a story that probably doesn't need the help. [Blu-ray]
Midnight Express,James Plath,Movie Metropolis,7.0,2009-7-19,A solid prison film that feels so real that if you heard a voiceover you'd swear it was a documentary.

Close Encounters of the Third Kind,Dorothy Smiljanich,Tampa Bay Times,10.0,2024-4-3,"Perhaps in this skeptical time, it is enough to know -- enough to wonder -- that a director and creator can still make a movie as awesome and visually satisfying as this one."
Close Encounters of the Third Kind,Gene Siskel,Chicago Tribune,8.75,2024-4-3,"[""Close Encounters""] attempts to conquer fear of the unknown with love.

Giant,Brian Eggert,Deep Focus Review,6.25,2022-3-3,"Watching Hudson, Taylor, and especially Dean in such an exquisite backdrop has its basic thrills. But any extended thought about what Giant wants to say or how it communicates its social consciousness to the viewer."
Giant,Mike Massie,Gone With The Twins,10.0,2020-8-22,"Dean's unstrained authenticity is remarkable, made more amusing when it conceals intellect and a ferocious ambition."
Giant,Philip Kemp,Total Film,6.0,2014-4-14,"The combination of director George Stevens and source novelist Edna Ferber, both given to expressions of overblown high seriousness, yields a long, slow, achingly self-important movie."

Lifeboat,Matt Brunson,Film Frenzy,8.75,2022-4-10,"There are many reasons to watch Alfred Hitchcock's Lifeboat, but chief among them is the opportunity to catch a rare film appearance by Tallulah Bankhead."
